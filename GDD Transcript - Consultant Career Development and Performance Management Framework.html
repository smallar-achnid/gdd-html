In Atlanta Doug Miller's been with a company for twenty years. Congratulations Doug, that's fantastic. Barbara Garmon with us for five years in Atlanta. In St. Louis Eric Mauer has been with the company for ten years.

I really appreciate all your good work, all the great contributions that you've made to Daugherty over the years.Highlights</p><p class="speaker">Highlights:</p><p class="spiel">		Here are some great highlights from around the Daugherty Enterprise. For the past several years in Minneapolis, we've been building relations within the Best Buy.com team. What started as unbundle with a plan has matured significantly by developing great work and building credibility.</p><p class="speaker">       Minneapolis:</p><p class="spiel">		Over the summer, Daugherty positioned its first ever development team with Best Buy.com, and securing that initial five-person engagement was a pivot point in our relationship. Team manager Nicole Manes, managing director Nick Reinbold, helped lead the charge, and now Best Buy's seen the value of what a Daugherty team can bring to the table. This perseverance and commitment to delivering the best for our customer is fundamentally changed Best Buys perspective and we are engaging in a much more strategic and impactful relationship with Best Buy.  In fact, I was just there last week, witnessed some of that with my own eyes. Great job, team.        Atlanta		In Atlanta our teams growing at a rapid pace. Over the last 3 months this business unit there has added 27 new teammates, averaging 9 new hires per month. Many of the interesting and highly impactful projects we're working on for our customers have propelled our growth including a proof of concept for the Home Depot that utilizes RFID and facial recognition technologies. And also a managed services engagement with General Parts company and their NAPA auto care application. Great job, Atlanta.</p><p class="spiel">       Chicago		In Chicago, Daugherty teammate, Sudesh Nayak, recently started a new engagement with Allstate Insurance company to help them track key performance metrics for their innovative virtual assistant program. The virtual assistant helps newer agency members get up to speed faster by mentoring and guiding them through common processes and requests. Sudesh is working with a team to develop visual dashboards that will help the Allstate team measure and report on the usage and effectiveness of the program, providing powerful insights for managers and executives. Great job, Sudesh.</p><p class="spiel">       Dallas		Just recently our Dallas team hosted their first ever scaled agile framework training course. Edwina from our St. Louis office made the trip down to lead the training alongside Dallas teammate Brian Bulaw. Over the course of 2 intensive days a group of our Daugherty teammates learned the ins and outs of SAFe. In fact 2 attendees have already received their certifications. Shubham Roy, and Irfan Rashid. Congratulations Shubham and Irfan and all of our teammates for completing the course.</p><p class="spiel">       St. Louis		In St. Louis, Daugherty just recently hosted its annual client and employee appreciation party at Grant's Farm. A large group of clients and several hundred Daugherty teammates gathered for a fun evening of food, drink, camaraderie, and music from Daugherty party band. It Was great to see so many familiar faces and meet some new ones as well. And to celebrate another great year of work and partnership with our local teams.</p><p class="spiel">Interview with Dan &amp; Coleen	We're going to talk today about progress that we've made with our consultant career development and performance management framework. Really excited about this, I believe it's very important and it's one of the ways that as we scale and grow the business we can ensure that everyone has more clarity around how their career can advance within Daugherty. Pretty important stuff. Today we're going to focus primarily on the roles and titles. Consultant, delivery leadership roles and titles. And as you know, we have an enterprise approach to working on this important framework and with representation from across the company.Ron Daugherty</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">		And two of our leaders from that team are with me today. Coleen Finnegan and Dan O'Keefe. And we're going to focus on the roles and the titles, consultant, delivery and leadership roles and consultant titles. Going to get into some more detail and this is part of the broader communication campaign. We just want to make sure that we continue to move forward and have consistency and clarity across this important initiative.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">		And so, Dan if you don't mind, could you share with us a little more detail about what we're doing with these roles and titles.</p><p class="speaker">Dan O’Keefe:</p><p class="spiel">		Sure Ron, I'm happy to do so and I think this is a really exciting time for the firm. We're really announcing some changes that we been talking about for a long time to create a better set of opportunities and formalize career growth options that all our consultants have as they develop their careers with us.</p><p class="speaker">Dan O’Keefe:</p><p class="spiel">		So as you mentioned, we're going to really focus on an element of our overall framework and that is around consultant titles, and delivery and leadership roles. And the delivery roles are those things that provide kind of the specific areas of solutions for our clients competency and skill development that each of our consultants bring.</p><p class="speaker">Dan O’Keefe:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel">		The leadership roles are really around the opportunity to take on key responsibilities [inaudible 00:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel">08:</p><p class="spiel">02] Daugherty and our clients achieve their success. And then titles are the dimension we use to really help define the career advancement opportunities and really represent the impact that you're having at Daugherty and at our clients. And so we've made revisions and updates all three of these dimensions that we want to share with the team today.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">		You're right, outstanding. Sounds great.</p><p class="speaker">Dan O’Keefe:</p><p class="spiel">		So Coleen, do you want to walk us through some of the details on the delivery roles?</p><p class="speaker">Coleen Finnegan:</p><p class="spiel">		Yeah, absolutely thanks, Dan. Ron, thanks for having us join you today.</p><p class="speaker">Coleen Finnegan:</p><p class="spiel">		So one of the things that I'll just touch on quickly are the delivery roles have had a major refresh. We've added over 25 new roles that's really all about recognizing all of our consultants career development, career path, and you can really pick your journey with Daugherty of what it is your wanting to pursue. And we can help figure out ways to support those aspirational roles that maybe you haven't been a part of now.</p><p class="speaker">Coleen Finnegan:</p><p class="spiel">		Many of our consultants really are doing multiple roles now, but we're just not necessarily formally recognizing it. Now we want to do that. You can be in multiple roles and across lines of service. So you don't have to feel like you're boxed. You can participate in more than one line of service and collect all the information about what's going on across the enterprise that you'd like. You will aligned with one particular line of service for the sheer fact we want to make sure people don't miss communications, you do have a community that you're regular touch pointing with. Things such as that.</p><p class="speaker">Coleen Finnegan:</p><p class="spiel">		Some of the new roles that we've added of the 25 are, product owner, scrub master, officially something we know many of our consultants have been doing for years now. UI designer, and user experience architects. So we're just really excited to recognize these and have really great descriptions around what those are, what it means to have that role. And quarterly we'll have a process in place that we can recognize our consultants for new roles that they have played at their various client sites. And if you have previous experience from before Daugherty, we'll absolutely recognize that as a role that you play as well.</p><p class="speaker">Coleen Finnegan:</p><p class="spiel">		Between now and the end of the year, your team manager will be scheduling a one on one with you to go through the roles that we currently have as an inventory that we're recognizing each of you for. Any title updates which I think Dan will touch on in just a couple of minutes, and to capture aspirational roles and talk about from a career development perspective what it is that you're wanting to do.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">		That's great, Coleen. Thanks for covering that. That's really good.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">		Should we talk a bit about the leadership roles as well?</p><p class="speaker">Coleen Finnegan:</p><p class="spiel">		Yeah, I think that be great.</p><p class="speaker">Coleen Finnegan:</p><p class="spiel">		So there are a few refreshes for the leadership roles for a couple of reasons; Consistency across the enterprise, which we have some roles in some business units and not in others and just recognizing from the market perspective and the way we Daugherty interact with the market and the way that we interact as a company. So we're engagement manager, senior team manager, these are roles that will be retiring but the importance of the function of those roles doesn't go away. We're just doing some renames and refreshes. We're adding things around LOS and solution leadership so that incompetency leaders, for people who want to have deep expertise, and particular technology or perhaps a particular Daugherty tool and methodology that they can really help from a business development and solution crafting for customers and in the market place.</p><p class="speaker">Coleen Finnegan:</p><p class="spiel">		One thing I want to point out to make sure that it doesn't really change is you roles can change depending on assignment. So you can be a team manager at one account and you move to a different client and you may not be a team manager for a time at that particular account, but it doesn't take away the fact that that's a role that we know and recognize that you can do as a Daugherty consultant.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">		Nice job covering that, Coleen. And you mention our engagement manager, senior engagement manager roles are being retired. Those are being replaced with client manager, senior client manager roles. We'll have a little more consistency now as we move up to client director, client partner in that same framework.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">		In fact, something that I really want to mention is that we're tightening up, we're improving changing some things to help us as we grow. And the titles and the roles, their definitions that's part of it. Some of the support structure that's going to come with it. The better training, the better support its so important for us and in fact it's clear to me one of the most important keys to our success is how we support each other as we grow. And so everyone here is very culturally oriented to being supportive but we don't always have the tools or the consistency in the approach. And so that's what we're adding.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">		We've talked about roles, consultant delivery roles, leadership roles. Let's talk about titles for a minute.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">		Dan if you wouldn't mind, can you give us some more detail on the new title structure.</p><p class="speaker">Dan O’Keefe:</p><p class="spiel">		Of course Ron, thanks.</p><p class="speaker">Dan O’Keefe:</p><p class="spiel">		Our goal when we started talking updating the title structure was really to achieve two things. One was to make sure we align our titles with the impact and the role that our consultants are having out at our clients. And secondly to somewhat reduce the complexity and the number of levels and some of the inconsistencies that had developed over the years with our titles.</p><p class="speaker">Dan O’Keefe:</p><p class="spiel">		We wanted to flatten the organization as much as we could and also just be very reflective of the market place language that we compete in everyday.</p><p class="speaker">Dan O’Keefe:</p><p class="spiel">		So we made a couple of changes and the changes largely impact those people that were at the manager or above level in our firm and we also wanted to make sure we provided a very clear framework and title path options for all of our consultants as they grow their careers with us.</p><p class="speaker">Dan O’Keefe:</p><p class="spiel">		So some of the key changes, we're introducing 2 paths; a client leadership path and a solution leadership path for our consultants to grow their careers in. And recognize that not everyone wants to manage client relationships and manage teams. Some people really want to build their careers around bringing deep contact expertise to our clients and having an impact more broadly. And so we're recognizing those 2 distinct paths.</p><p class="speaker">Dan O’Keefe:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel">		We're revising the principal consultant title to really reflect the title that our most experienced consultants have, and [inaudible 00:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel">14:</p><p class="spiel">59] careers in for a long period of time if they don't want to pursue one of the leadership paths.</p><p class="speaker">Dan O’Keefe:</p><p class="spiel">		And we're updating and refining kind of performance expectations for our director title and our senior director title on that client leadership path and for the senior principal, master principal titles on our solution leadership path. So we think this makes a lot of great opportunity for our consultants to choose the path and the way in which they want to grow their career. And it also gives us just some flexibility as we grow and leverage the business more broadly.</p><p class="speaker">Dan O’Keefe:</p><p class="spiel">		As Coleen mentioned everyone will have a one on one before now and the end of the year with their team manager or their line of service leader or their business unit leadership, to really talk through This impacts them and creates opportunities for growth that they can take advantage of. We're really excited about this and hopefully as you come to understand the details it will show that we're really trying to create more options and more opportunity for each and every one of our consultants.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">		Great coverage of that, Dan. And in some ways this is a really simple thing, but it has so much importance to the company, to the organization. We want to make sure it's done right, we want to make sure we all benefit as we move forward. And so just some great thing have been put in place, we really appreciate the good work done by the enterprise team.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">		And Dan what are some of the next steps coming up?</p><p class="speaker">Dan O’Keefe:</p><p class="spiel">		In all the upcoming business unit meetings, some of which happened last week and some that are scheduled for the balance of this month, we'll be introducing more detail in those business unit meetings that all our consultants can ask questions and be a part of.</p><p class="speaker">Dan O’Keefe:</p><p class="spiel">		Attached to this podcast are some material that will answer a frequently asked questions, provide access to a lot of detailed information that has been developed, describing each of the new delivery roles and what it takes to be qualified for those roles.</p><p class="speaker">Dan O’Keefe:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel">		And then most importantly, as I mentioned a moment ago, we'll be scheduling and conducting one on one meetings with every one of our consultants over the balance of this year to really share what we understand to be the delivery roles that you're currently qualified for, and talk about new titles and new performance expectations, associated with those titles and make sure we're aligned with each and every consultants career growth desires and expectations. And so, there's a whole bunch of communication that we [inaudible 00:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel">17:</p><p class="spiel">50] all the way down to a whole series of one on one meetings.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">		Very good. That's great stuff. And very important to us. And as we roll this out please continue to give us your feedback. Any questions, or concerns or comments on how to do this even better. Really appreciate the great work done by Dan, Coleen, and the entire executive group that's been meeting on a regular basis. You've made a few trips into St.Louis now, haven't you? Just to make sure that we have the team all together in one place.</p><p class="speaker">Coleen Finnegan:</p><p class="spiel">		Yeah, we have weekly calls. We've been to St. Louis 3 times as you've mentioned, Ron. And we'll continue to have the weekly calls and figure out what it makes sense for us together as a group in person as we did before through the whole framework.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">		Fantastic. So this is part of the bigger initiative, we're making progress we're picking up speed, and I gave you my commitment that we're going to continue to grow this company aggressively. We're having a lot of success and I want that success to translate to opportunity for all of you, to all of us.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel">		Thanks so much for listening, we'll talk to you soon.</p>
