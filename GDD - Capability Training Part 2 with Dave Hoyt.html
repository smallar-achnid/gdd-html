Let's take a look at some now. In Minneapolis, Daugherty's in the spotlight at Cargill as two of our consultant-led projects have been chosen as finalists for Cargill's Breakthrough Awards. The Breakthrough Awards are an internal enterprise-wide contest created to recognize individuals and teams who've demonstrated breakthrough results that align to Cargill's corporate strategy. What started as a pool of nearly 1000 project entries has been narrowed to a group of 30 finalists. Daugherty Consultants, Kevin Baier and Ivan Widman are leaders for two of the finalists, which are Program Gemini and the Wall Street Suite Implementation. This is a tremendous honor, and a great recognition for our leadership at Cargill. Great job, team Daugherty.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:	</p><a class="timeStamp" href="https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/_-SGmOmo0CzNTRCY9KuwFuS9pib6mnl2KVMJwwi3npYrOLGu2EHHg7pfc22FAwWFnDtcfaNi71ITnv0BsBkam7CxkCc?loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;ts=131.02">02:11</a><p class="spiel">	In New York/New Jersey, we've added our first two software engineering consultants to team, [Harry Tanningco 00:02:16] and [Aaron Traas 00:02:17], first of many. And while our work to date in the New York area has been primarily focused on delivery leadership and business alignment, we're actively working to broaden and expand our capabilities in software engineering, as well as data and analytics, as we continue to build out the team, bring more value to the market place, and grow our footprint in the New York/New Jersey area. Very exciting.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:	</p><a class="timeStamp" href="https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/_-SGmOmo0CzNTRCY9KuwFuS9pib6mnl2KVMJwwi3npYrOLGu2EHHg7pfc22FAwWFnDtcfaNi71ITnv0BsBkam7CxkCc?loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;ts=164.01">02:44</a><p class="spiel">	In St. Louis, Daugherty's partnering with Express Scripts to create a next generation platform that will allow ESI to rapidly introduce new product offerings to the market. What will start as three separate Daugherty teams of five consultants will grow to more than 50 team members in the coming months as we help Express Scripts devise a strategy, evaluate technologies, architect the solution, and ensure successful delivery. This great win was made possible by our thought leadership in the software engineering and data and analytic space, as well as our ability and commitment to scale fast using Daugherty development center.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:	</p><a class="timeStamp" href="https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/_-SGmOmo0CzNTRCY9KuwFuS9pib6mnl2KVMJwwi3npYrOLGu2EHHg7pfc22FAwWFnDtcfaNi71ITnv0BsBkam7CxkCc?loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;ts=204.69">03:24</a><p class="spiel">	In Dallas, we've officially kicked off our first development center project.

The client had high praise for our own Todd [Scheumer 00:04:12], commenting on how he was able to clearly articulate and engage with his audience on a very complex and emotional topic for the company. While there's still a lot of work to do before there's full alignment between McDonald's and their owner/operators, McDonald's in confident that with Daugherty's leadership, they'll successfully finish this highly visible project.

We brought in 12 college candidates from five different schools for an all day event of interviews and team building exercises meant to test the candidates baseline knowledge of one or more of Daugherty's lines of service, but also to gauge their eagerness and ability to learn and engage with the team. The event was a major success, and we've already accepted four new teammates to join our software engineering and data and analytics teams. That's fantastic, and so many wonderful highlights from all around the Daugherty Enterprise.

Could you give us an update?</p><p class="speaker">Dave Hoyt:	</p><a class="timeStamp" href="https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/_-SGmOmo0CzNTRCY9KuwFuS9pib6mnl2KVMJwwi3npYrOLGu2EHHg7pfc22FAwWFnDtcfaNi71ITnv0BsBkam7CxkCc?loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;ts=334.37">05:34</a><p class="spiel">	Yes. We've released all the videos out to the team, and we've gotten some really nice, positive feedback on the videos, and we actually have conducted our first beta in-person training session, and that has gone well, and we're making some adjustments, and moving forward with that as well.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:	</p><a class="timeStamp" href="https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/_-SGmOmo0CzNTRCY9KuwFuS9pib6mnl2KVMJwwi3npYrOLGu2EHHg7pfc22FAwWFnDtcfaNi71ITnv0BsBkam7CxkCc?loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;ts=350.76">05:50</a><p class="spiel">	Yeah, fantastic.

And so what we thought we'd touch on today is just talk a little bit more about the foundational competency capabilities that we have. We'll talk a little bit about the engagement models we leverage. Then to your point Ron, we'll begin to move into a little bit more of, how do you use this information. We'll talk a little bit about a technique we call the skeleton key, and our solution crafting training as well.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:	</p><a class="timeStamp" href="https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/_-SGmOmo0CzNTRCY9KuwFuS9pib6mnl2KVMJwwi3npYrOLGu2EHHg7pfc22FAwWFnDtcfaNi71ITnv0BsBkam7CxkCc?loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;ts=389.58">06:29</a><p class="spiel">	Dave, I can't resist, my skeleton joke was edited out last podcast.

We had covered a couple of our important foundational competencies in the last podcast. We had talked a little bit about data and analytics, and software engineering. But the other two that we really should spend a couple minutes talking about are delivery leadership and business alignment.</p><p class="speaker">Dave Hoyt:	</p><a class="timeStamp" href="https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/_-SGmOmo0CzNTRCY9KuwFuS9pib6mnl2KVMJwwi3npYrOLGu2EHHg7pfc22FAwWFnDtcfaNi71ITnv0BsBkam7CxkCc?loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;ts=433.44">07:13</a><p class="spiel">	On the delivery leadership front, that obviously has been a central part of the work that we've been doing for a long while. And while there's certainly leadership that exists in all our lines of service, and all our roles, what we're really talking about here is more traditional project management, program management, portfolio management, product management, as well as now agile leadership as well. All focused in that area. We have some great capabilities in that area.</p><p class="speaker">Dave Hoyt:	</p><a class="timeStamp" href="https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/_-SGmOmo0CzNTRCY9KuwFuS9pib6mnl2KVMJwwi3npYrOLGu2EHHg7pfc22FAwWFnDtcfaNi71ITnv0BsBkam7CxkCc?loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;ts=463.77">07:43</a><p class="spiel">	We'll talk about some of our success stories. A good one to highlight in Cargill. Where we started there by providing some thought leadership, and some advisory workshops to the head of their North American PMO. Pretty quickly translated that into deploying an unbundled, Daugherty manager in that space, who could connect the Daugherty capabilities into their situation.</p><p class="speaker">Dave Hoyt:	</p><a class="timeStamp" href="https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/_-SGmOmo0CzNTRCY9KuwFuS9pib6mnl2KVMJwwi3npYrOLGu2EHHg7pfc22FAwWFnDtcfaNi71ITnv0BsBkam7CxkCc?loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;ts=487.04">08:07</a><p class="spiel">	Then from there moved very quickly into selling in a collaborative managed team approach, where we're providing all the external services team members to an over 60-member North American PMO, so over half of that PMO are Daugherty consultants now, driving the most strategic initiatives for Cargill.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:	</p><a class="timeStamp" href="https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/_-SGmOmo0CzNTRCY9KuwFuS9pib6mnl2KVMJwwi3npYrOLGu2EHHg7pfc22FAwWFnDtcfaNi71ITnv0BsBkam7CxkCc?loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;ts=507.01">08:27</a><p class="spiel">	Yeah, it's a great win. I remember Dora [Laisman 00:08:29] was our unbundled program manager in the door, and then Dave [Hew 00:08:34] and the enterprise team, worked with Dora, and our other leaders in Minneapolis, to bring in some thought leadership, some leading practices, some Daugherty tools and methods, and what a great win that turned into.</p><p class="speaker">Dave Hoyt:	</p><a class="timeStamp" href="https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/_-SGmOmo0CzNTRCY9KuwFuS9pib6mnl2KVMJwwi3npYrOLGu2EHHg7pfc22FAwWFnDtcfaNi71ITnv0BsBkam7CxkCc?loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;ts=531.46">08:51</a><p class="spiel">	It really was, and it was a good example of where looking at bringing in the thought leadership, and how we engage, and the right strategic sourcing mindset really connected well.</p><p class="speaker">Dave Hoyt:	</p><a class="timeStamp" href="https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/_-SGmOmo0CzNTRCY9KuwFuS9pib6mnl2KVMJwwi3npYrOLGu2EHHg7pfc22FAwWFnDtcfaNi71ITnv0BsBkam7CxkCc?loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;ts=543.11">09:03</a><p class="spiel">	The other area that I'll mention in the delivery leadership area too, which is a red hot topic right now, is a lot of organizations are still wrestling with how do they take their old traditional program management office, and transition that to be an agile-friendly, agile-ready, agile-portfolio office. And so we have some great methods and techniques around that, and some good experience that really applies right in that space.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:	</p><a class="timeStamp" href="https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/_-SGmOmo0CzNTRCY9KuwFuS9pib6mnl2KVMJwwi3npYrOLGu2EHHg7pfc22FAwWFnDtcfaNi71ITnv0BsBkam7CxkCc?loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;ts=569.91">09:29</a><p class="spiel">	That's a great point. Delivery leadership isn't yesterday's core capability or competency, there's just a next generation, a next wave that is top of mind for most organizations. What does delivery leadership look like in the agile world? What is project manager, business analyst, scrum master, product manager, product owner, what are all those things in terms of delivery leadership? Which are redundant, which are older, which are newer, which co-exist? All those kinds of things.</p><p class="speaker">Dave Hoyt:	</p><a class="timeStamp" href="https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/_-SGmOmo0CzNTRCY9KuwFuS9pib6mnl2KVMJwwi3npYrOLGu2EHHg7pfc22FAwWFnDtcfaNi71ITnv0BsBkam7CxkCc?loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;ts=606.54">10:06</a><p class="spiel">	Yes, that's really right. And as I'm out there talking with clients, very few companies feel like that they've got that figured out. They've maybe made some big adjustments, but even those big adjustments don't really seem to be working the way they had anticipated. So they need help there, and we can certainly help.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:	</p><a class="timeStamp" href="https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/_-SGmOmo0CzNTRCY9KuwFuS9pib6mnl2KVMJwwi3npYrOLGu2EHHg7pfc22FAwWFnDtcfaNi71ITnv0BsBkam7CxkCc?loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;ts=622.88">10:22</a><p class="spiel">	As you learn about these capabilities, and hear more, get an update, hear more detail, think about what we have to offer, and what you're doing, and what your customer situation is, then you're in a position to think about ways we can help more. And that's what the whole things about, isn't it? The capability and solution crafting training. That's where it leads us. Delivering more value, bringing more help to our customers.</p><p class="speaker">Dave Hoyt:	</p><a class="timeStamp" href="https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/_-SGmOmo0CzNTRCY9KuwFuS9pib6mnl2KVMJwwi3npYrOLGu2EHHg7pfc22FAwWFnDtcfaNi71ITnv0BsBkam7CxkCc?loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;ts=648.38">10:48</a><p class="spiel">	That's absolutely right. And so closing out that foundational competency space, the other big area is business alignment, and there's a lot in that space. I mean, certainly here again, the traditional business analysis and requirements, but also we now have product planning, advanced backlog planning, and then we also include into that process optimization and organizational change management. So there's a lot in that space. And we have many great successes there too.</p><p class="speaker">Dave Hoyt:	</p><a class="timeStamp" href="https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/_-SGmOmo0CzNTRCY9KuwFuS9pib6mnl2KVMJwwi3npYrOLGu2EHHg7pfc22FAwWFnDtcfaNi71ITnv0BsBkam7CxkCc?loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;ts=677.93">11:17</a><p class="spiel">	Southwest Airlines would be a good example of that. As about a year ago they were working to rapidly expand their capabilities to fly internationally, and fly over large bodies of water. They had a program called the ETOPS program, and they acknowledged that they were really bad at planning these very large initiatives. There were cross-product area, cross-program. So we came in and helped them using a version of our advanced backlog planning techniques to help them rapidly put together, and define, and approach, an agile approach for deploying those capabilities. That went extremely well. It was they ultimately ended up using for budgetary purposes, and ultimately to drive the program forward. The really fun part of that, is that in just in the way it should, that led to a tremendous amount of software engineering work. So multiple additional development pods being put to work.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:	</p><a class="timeStamp" href="https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/_-SGmOmo0CzNTRCY9KuwFuS9pib6mnl2KVMJwwi3npYrOLGu2EHHg7pfc22FAwWFnDtcfaNi71ITnv0BsBkam7CxkCc?loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;ts=734.52">12:14</a><p class="spiel">	Just in the way it should, yep. I absolutely agree with that. In fact, I was just on the phone yesterday with our Southwest team, and our Delta Airlines team. We had our leaders, Jason Myers, Colleen Finnegan there in Dallas, and then in Atlanta, some of our leaders, Suzanne and [Ameer 00:12:37], Dan O'Keefe, and we were brainstorming about what we're doing in Southwest that can help us at Delta and vice versa. And one of the great examples that came up was the one that you just shared, Dave. It's such a great story in terms of bringing some thought leadership, and in this case, how to better estimate, and evaluate the scope of major agile initiatives. That was part of it. And so knowing that, knowing that we did that at Southwest, can spark some ideas for what we can do at Delta.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:	</p><a class="timeStamp" href="https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/_-SGmOmo0CzNTRCY9KuwFuS9pib6mnl2KVMJwwi3npYrOLGu2EHHg7pfc22FAwWFnDtcfaNi71ITnv0BsBkam7CxkCc?loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;ts=790.5">13:10</a><p class="spiel">	But you know what? That particular example is not restricted to the airline industry in any way. So the more that we understand about our capabilities, and in fact, successes we're having, and what we're doing, and how we use the capability to open a door. We talked about this yesterday, we've been at Southwest for a long time, and we were really struggling to increase our footprint. To expand our footprint in the software engineering area. We kept running into customers who said, &quot;Well we kind of have our vendors that we work with, and we're in good shape. We don't need any more help.&quot; But when we brought in a better way to do something. Brought in lessons learned, leading practices, thought leadership, then they said, &quot;Well gee, you guys, you're pretty smart, and we have this big initiative over here. Let's just give this thing a try. See if you can really do it.&quot; And really did it. Then they said, &quot;Well gee, if you can do that, you know what, now we've gotta build a lot of software. Let's use Daugherty for that.&quot;</p><p class="speaker">Dave Hoyt:	</p><a class="timeStamp" href="https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/_-SGmOmo0CzNTRCY9KuwFuS9pib6mnl2KVMJwwi3npYrOLGu2EHHg7pfc22FAwWFnDtcfaNi71ITnv0BsBkam7CxkCc?loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;ts=858.35">14:18</a><p class="spiel">	That's right.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:	</p><a class="timeStamp" href="https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/_-SGmOmo0CzNTRCY9KuwFuS9pib6mnl2KVMJwwi3npYrOLGu2EHHg7pfc22FAwWFnDtcfaNi71ITnv0BsBkam7CxkCc?loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;ts=860.08">14:20</a><p class="spiel">	I love when things play out that way, and they will so many times if we're just there thinking about the best way to help the customer.</p><p class="speaker">Dave Hoyt:	</p><a class="timeStamp" href="https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/_-SGmOmo0CzNTRCY9KuwFuS9pib6mnl2KVMJwwi3npYrOLGu2EHHg7pfc22FAwWFnDtcfaNi71ITnv0BsBkam7CxkCc?loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;ts=869.42">14:29</a><p class="spiel">	Right. If we think about all these capabilities, there's a lot of great capabilities, and more to come in the training, but one of the aspects that's really interesting is that not even only what we do, but how we do it. So the engagement models are another aspect that we'll talk a little bit more about. In many ways, we can differentiate just in the way we engage with the client. And new and creating engagement models that are really thoughtful around accomplishing their business objectives, so that might mean a variation of managed services. What we call collaborative managed services, which is a different version of managed services. It can really deliver great value. That's the model we use at Anheuser Busch, supporting the bookends of the business. Selling all the beer, and brewing all the beer.</p><p class="speaker">Dave Hoyt:	</p><a class="timeStamp" href="https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/_-SGmOmo0CzNTRCY9KuwFuS9pib6mnl2KVMJwwi3npYrOLGu2EHHg7pfc22FAwWFnDtcfaNi71ITnv0BsBkam7CxkCc?loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;ts=918.25">15:18</a><p class="spiel">	But then in addition to that, we also have the collaborative managed team approach, which is what we talked a little bit about in the context of Cargill. Part of the training videos are to explain the differences between those modules, and to help the team begin to think through when those different models make the most sense.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:	</p><a class="timeStamp" href="https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/_-SGmOmo0CzNTRCY9KuwFuS9pib6mnl2KVMJwwi3npYrOLGu2EHHg7pfc22FAwWFnDtcfaNi71ITnv0BsBkam7CxkCc?loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;ts=935.97">15:35</a><p class="spiel">	Okay. An engagement model walks into a bar ... No, I'm just kidding. I'm just being silly now. You can edit that out, by the way. I love that point. And collaborative is such an important word there, because when we talk to our customers, so often, they're used to either just bringing in contract labor, or completely losing control, sending it offshore, outsourcing altogether. Our collaborative approach allows us to take on more accountability, while leading the client with the appropriate amount of control and involvement. We can turn that dial. So collaborative managed service, collaborative managed team, just really engagement models that are somewhat unique to Daugherty, build on a lot of things that are out there, but in a better way. They suit our customers so well because they allow them to stay involved, and at the same time, just gain greater leverage and effectiveness from their partner.</p><p class="speaker">Dave Hoyt:	</p><a class="timeStamp" href="https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/_-SGmOmo0CzNTRCY9KuwFuS9pib6mnl2KVMJwwi3npYrOLGu2EHHg7pfc22FAwWFnDtcfaNi71ITnv0BsBkam7CxkCc?loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;ts=1001.82">16:41</a><p class="spiel">	Absolutely right. And it avoids what is commonly referred to in the industry as the watermelon syndrome. As our other competitors that are not as strong at Daugherty try to do these things, they end up with clumsy managed services models that are really just all about opening tickets, and closing tickets. And the reason why they call it the watermelon syndrome is it looks green on the outside, but when you get down to the heart of it, the business value delivered, it's bright red.</p><p class="speaker">Dave Hoyt:	</p><a class="timeStamp" href="https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/_-SGmOmo0CzNTRCY9KuwFuS9pib6mnl2KVMJwwi3npYrOLGu2EHHg7pfc22FAwWFnDtcfaNi71ITnv0BsBkam7CxkCc?loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;ts=1030.98">17:10</a><p class="spiel">	And, so at Daugherty, with these models, we're able to really deliver to the business value. The core business value that needs to be achieved.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:	</p><a class="timeStamp" href="https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/_-SGmOmo0CzNTRCY9KuwFuS9pib6mnl2KVMJwwi3npYrOLGu2EHHg7pfc22FAwWFnDtcfaNi71ITnv0BsBkam7CxkCc?loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;ts=1039.15">17:19</a><p class="spiel">	I love it. We marketing guys, we should work up a graphic, a picture of a watermelon with a circle around it and a line through it. Daugherty, collaborative managed teams and services, no watermelon.</p><p class="speaker">Dave Hoyt:	</p><a class="timeStamp" href="https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/_-SGmOmo0CzNTRCY9KuwFuS9pib6mnl2KVMJwwi3npYrOLGu2EHHg7pfc22FAwWFnDtcfaNi71ITnv0BsBkam7CxkCc?loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;ts=1052.47">17:32</a><p class="spiel">	That's right. That's right. There's a lot that we're talking about here. It can feel a little overwhelming, but the good news is that you don't have to remember everything about every capability. And in fact, we have a couple techniques that can help. One of which we refer to as the skeleton key technique. And that's an old analogy, but a skeleton key is a key that will open almost any door. And the idea is there's some techniques we can use that helps our consultants open those doors to opportunities, in a way that's extremely comfortable, and value added to the client. So part of the training is talking through that skeleton key technique, and how to best utilize it with your clients.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:	</p><a class="timeStamp" href="https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/_-SGmOmo0CzNTRCY9KuwFuS9pib6mnl2KVMJwwi3npYrOLGu2EHHg7pfc22FAwWFnDtcfaNi71ITnv0BsBkam7CxkCc?loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;ts=1095.79">18:15</a><p class="spiel">	Yeah. Yeah. And it's a technique anyone can use.</p><p class="speaker">Dave Hoyt:	</p><a class="timeStamp" href="https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/_-SGmOmo0CzNTRCY9KuwFuS9pib6mnl2KVMJwwi3npYrOLGu2EHHg7pfc22FAwWFnDtcfaNi71ITnv0BsBkam7CxkCc?loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;ts=1097.83">18:17</a><p class="spiel">	That's right. Then finally, I'll just mention solution crafting training. That's a big aspect of the in-person class, which our consultants love that aspect of the training. It's dominantly role play, and it's really all focused around how do we shift into the right mindset. It's easy to fall into a trap, or we become order takers, or we become process mechanics, just going through the steps. But how do we really step into that role of being an advisor to our clients. And solution crafting is right at the heart of that. And what we do is we provide a number of tools, job aids, techniques, to help with that solution crafting approach. And more than talk about them, we actually try them out in these role plays, and it's a lot of fun. I'm sure everyone will enjoy it when you get to that part.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:	</p><a class="timeStamp" href="https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/_-SGmOmo0CzNTRCY9KuwFuS9pib6mnl2KVMJwwi3npYrOLGu2EHHg7pfc22FAwWFnDtcfaNi71ITnv0BsBkam7CxkCc?loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;ts=1148.53">19:08</a><p class="spiel">	Thank you for telling me.

That's great. That's great. I love it. We're putting that knowledge, that important knowledge of Daugherty's capabilities to use to help a customer. Great, great stuff, and how you do it. One thing I think is worth pointing out is that no one's expected to sit through the training, and just be an expert in every way in going on and solving every problem, but we all learn as we go, we grow, it's an opportunity to develop ourselves as we help our customers more. And just as more of us and you become really strong in using these techniques, ideas, principles, then we'll have more leaders by example. And that's when things really start to catch on. Really, really start to accelerate. We're right on the verge of that. You can see it happening more and more every day.</p><p class="speaker">Dave Hoyt:	</p><a class="timeStamp" href="https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/_-SGmOmo0CzNTRCY9KuwFuS9pib6mnl2KVMJwwi3npYrOLGu2EHHg7pfc22FAwWFnDtcfaNi71ITnv0BsBkam7CxkCc?loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;ts=1233.46">20:33</a><p class="spiel">	Right.
