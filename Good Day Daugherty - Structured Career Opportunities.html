<p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel"> On today's podcast we'll continue with the theme of how to translate Daugherty success to career opportunity for all of us. I'll also be sharing some very interesting company highlights and the contest continues. All this and more on today's episode of Good Day Daugherty.I'd like to share two important anniversary dates with you. In St.Louis, Andy Mauer's been with the company for 10 years. Really appreciate that Andy. And in Atlanta, Dave Rowlinson has been with the company for five years. Andy, Dave, really appreciate all the good work you've done for Daugherty. Congratulations. </p><p class="spiel">And now for some more outstanding company highlights, in Minneapolis, Mark Martin and Alex Harms are in the midst of migrating Cargill's legacy systems to SAP. The Cargill environment is very complex and these transitions are exceptionally challenging to manage and to implement, but Mark and Alex have done a tremendous job. In fact, the global IT manager at Cargill was so amazed, he commented that this was one of the most successful SAP transitions he's ever witnessed. Great job Mark and Alex and the rest of our Daugherty team at Cargill. </p><p class="spiel">In Atlanta, our Daugherty team at Genuine Parts Company recently captured two strategic wins, unseating an incumbent competitor based on our suppose value proposition. Man, I love that. First, Daugherty was awarded a managed service contract to upgrade and evolve PROlink, GPC's B2B portal that drives over a billion dollars in annual sales revenue. Secondly, Daugherty is taking over leadership of the auto parts group pricing program, a very strategic collection of projects for GPC. These wins are directly attributable to both the suppose value we've demonstrated in previous engagements and the leadership of John DeWitt.  Great job, team.</p><p class="spiel">Last month, several members of the Daugherty New York team participated in the annual Muck Fest MS event. Do not say that three times fast, alongside our Express Client. Muck Fest MS is a 5K mud and obstacle course designed by special effects and event productions specialists from Hollywood with proceeds going to support the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. Daugherty teammates Steve Evans, Jeff Golden, and Ademur Perez got their hands dirty with several members of Express Scripts, all for a good cause.</p><p class="spiel">In Chicago, congratulations are in order for our Daugherty team at Walgreens as we've expanded our product management team within the RX Renewal program. That is great. This program is a strategic venture to build and deploy a new prescription processing platform that will be used globally by all pharmacies. As Walgreens looks to accelerate development, they've turned to Daugherty first based on our suppose track record of delivery. The team will be advising on all aspects of pharmacy operations across mail order, home delivery, and retail channels. Great work, Walgreens team.</p><p class="spiel">Our Daugherty teammates in Dallas are advising within the office of the CIO at Southwest Airlines, providing an actionable strategic roadmap for their technology planning team as they embark on a scaled agile transformation. Daugherty's Columbus Brown is offering counsel to the senior technology manager to help execute her vision for improving the team's dynamics as they interact with the CIO's direct reports and business unit leaders. Columbus created a custom team assessment and workshop series that has led to substantial progress, team cohesiveness, and has positioned Daugherty well at the senior most levels within Southwest Airlines. Good job, Columbus.</p><p class="spiel"> So many wonderful enterprise wide highlights, so much great work that's being done everyday by you out there. I really appreciate it. Great job, everybody.Ron Daugherty</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel"> We're here to cover a very important topic today, consultant career development and performance management. I'm excited to share with you that we have an enterprise wide team focused on this now, representatives from every business unit, and Dan O'Keefe, our managing director in Atlanta, has joined me today. He's one of the task force leaders helping us drive this initiative forward. We're going give you an update on where things stand, our approach, and our milestones moving forward. Dan, if you don't mind, if you could just fill us in on the progress that we've made.</p><p class="speaker">Dan O'Keefe:</p><p class="spiel"> Sure, Ron. I'm happy to be here today and to share this with the team. A couple weeks ago, we had our first kickoff meeting where the group that you mentioned all assembled in St. Louis for a full day to really accelerate the completion of a lot of the work that has been started previously, and what we want to do today is really share the outcome of that meeting and really, very specifically, our plans to deliver to all of our consultants this year some of the first improvements and refinements to our overarching career development framework. I'm very excited about the progress we've made and the efforts and activity that everyone's going see over the upcoming weeks.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel"> That's fantastic, Dan. I really appreciate your help and the help of the other leaders who joined us. Who are those leaders, Dan?</p><p class="speaker">Dan O'Keefe:</p><p class="spiel"> Sure, Colleen, Wes Strait, Scott Stein, Nick Gottner, Annette Fog, Eric Siboda, and Eric Klotz all working very closely with Jan is really that core team.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel"> All right, fantastic. Good. </p><p class="speaker">Dan O'Keefe:</p><p class="spiel"> Let's start by one of the things we wanted to do as a working group is to really clearly define the guiding principles of what are we trying to accomplish as we put in place a better career development and performance management framework for all of our consultants, and we defined three core guiding principles that we think are important to share with everyone as we begin to communicate what it is we're trying to achieve here. </p><p class="speaker">Dan O'Keefe:</p><p class="spiel"> It really starts with our goal is to really grow and retain and develop happy consultants, to make this the employer of choice in every one of our markets and to really ensure that we're giving the right career growth opportunities to all of our team members. </p><p class="speaker">Dan O'Keefe:</p><p class="spiel"> We want to make sure the process provides for active and engaged coaching, that we help identify and reward at the successes and accomplishments of our team members but also identifies ways in which you can grow and what's going be necessary to achieve your long-term and short-term career growth opportunities. </p><p class="speaker">Dan O'Keefe:</p><p class="spiel"> These are all the things that we've always been doing, we wanted to just be very clear about what our goals and objectives are as we refine and improve our processes.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel"> I like that a lot, Dan. It's so tremendously important to us, it's something we all want but as the company continues to grow in scale, over 1100 employees now, growing fast, that we need more rigor discipline process, structure, and consistency around these things so we can execute and do the translation of the success of the company to the opportunity to the individual and that's just a little ... that's a little trickier kind of a thing to do than it might appear as the company grows and continues to grow. I'm really excited about what we're doing here. I think this will help take us to the next level as a business in a way that will be good for all of us. </p><p class="speaker">Dan O'Keefe:</p><p class="spiel"> I couldn't agree more, Ron. One of the things that we're putting in place is we have so many great things going on throughout the enterprise around career development, what we wanted to do is in a single page kind of represent what are all those piece parts that we have in place, that we want to refine and improve, and so we've put together this framework, this consultant development and performance management framework that includes 12 components and we're going share this with everyone as an attachment to the podcast, but what I wanted to do is quickly walk through what are those components and then, very specifically, what's our timeline and commitment to advancing and improving those?</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel"> Great. Wonderful.</p><p class="speaker">Dan O'Keefe:</p><p class="spiel"> It all starts with is the foundation, obviously is the consultant alignment processes. Ensuring our consultants are getting the right client engagement opportunities, opportunities to grow with their clients and develop the skills that they want. That is the foundation for all things. As you've said many times, Ron, everything happens out at the client and our career development process is founded and grounded in that very important consultant process.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel"> Very good.</p><p class="speaker">Dan O'Keefe:</p><p class="spiel"> On the left hand side of the framework, you see the box labeled career opportunities. We're in the process of updating and refining and refreshing the title structure that we have in place and creating more opportunities and more recognition of the very career paths that people want to pursue. We're refreshing and refining and greatly expanding the delivery roles that we will recognize and train and develop our consultants to achieve and also refreshing and updating the leadership roles that we will have available for consultants to grow into, both at our clients and as part of our line of service leadership. So we believe the updates around titles and roles are a great foundational component that we've spent a lot of time talking about as an organization and we are committed to having this completed, deployed, training done and all of this communication done this year, really before the end of November, and I'll talk more about the milestones in a moment. We think a lot of great advancement in terms of the career opportunities and career paths is going be articulated as we role out some of those updates. </p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel"> Excellent. </p><p class="speaker">Dan O'Keefe:</p><p class="spiel"> The center of the framework really builds upon a lot of the core processes that we want to have in place that are in place today and we want to update as it relates to really managing the coaching and performance management process with our team members. Obviously it begins with team manager one on ones that happen everyday throughout the firm. We're going put in place some tools and guidelines and approaches to really help our team managers be more effective with those team manager one on ones, and it's starting with some training that's going be happening in October, really associated with the new roles, but we want to help our team managers be better coaches and counselors and guiders to their consultants.</p><p class="speaker">Dan O'Keefe:</p><p class="spiel"> We're going refresh and refine the performance review process and have that ready to go at the beginning of the next year so that as the year end processes and the 2019 planning activities begin, we have a well-defined simplified and very effective performance feedback structure in place. Obviously we're continuously monitoring the market, we're continuously reacting to pressures around salary and how do we make sure we're providing very solid market relevant salaries and spot rewards and recognition. Just earlier today we had a meeting here in Atlanta to recognize one of our team members that has just been doing an outstanding job at the client. We're not locked into specific timelines and frameworks, we want it to be flexible, we want to really make this while it is something that has to be leverageable and can help us grow, we don't want to take away that flexibility that has been so important and a hallmark of how we operate. </p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel"> Good. </p><p class="speaker">Dan O'Keefe:</p><p class="spiel"> On the far right hand side of the framework are a bunch of other supporting processes that we're looking at refining and these refinements are in process and ongoing. Things like how can we always look to improve our new hire orientation? In many of our business units, we're growing pretty rapidly and are adding consultants every week. We want to make sure their first few months are the most productive and effective as possible and that they get well engaged with all of the things the firm has to offer early on. </p><p class="speaker">Dan O'Keefe:</p><p class="spiel"> Same as when you join one of our client teams, we want to make sure that our client team, our onboarding process is as up-to-date and current and effective as possible. </p><p class="speaker">Dan O'Keefe:</p><p class="spiel"> Here in Atlanta and in Chicago, we have new hire buddy program or peer advisor program. We want to look at how can we expand that to the entire firm so that as you onboard and in your first year you have someone you can look to as a coach and a mentor alongside your TM and engagement manager that you may be working with. As everyone who joins us knows, we do a tremendous amount of training. All we're looking to do here is continually refresh and refine that, put some curriculum guidelines around it, so if you want to achieve one of these new delivery roles, what is the training you need to accomplish in order to achieve that? We just want to continuously look at how can we improve that.</p><p class="speaker">Dan O'Keefe:</p><p class="spiel"> As I said, all of these are things that we have in place, but we're working to refine and update many of them as we speak and I think this is a good way to introduce some of our commitments around milestones and timing that we've outlined.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel"> Nice job covering that, Dan. You know, it's a really intriguing situation that we're in. I'm proud of the opportunity that we've been able to create for our teammates throughout the 33-year history of the company and today there's more opportunity at Daugherty than there's ever been, by far. So, our attrition should be the lowest it's ever been in the history of the company, but it's not. I wont' say that it's out of control, but it's not where I want it to be. The single most common reason that someone leaves the team here is because they're not sure of the opportunity here. Well, ah. Holy cow. That kinda hurts my feelings. We've got so much going on here and yet we're not doing a good enough job translating that and making it clear to our teammates what that opportunity is, and this framework is going be a huge step forward for us and this is another ... this is an example of the sort of thing that we have to bring more focus and make a greater investment in and deliver greater results to our teammates in terms of tangible, real ways that their career can move forward, that they can be successful here at Daugherty in a meaningful way.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel"> This is right at the center of that and I'm very grateful to you and all the others who've been involved helping us move this forward. Dan, maybe you can tell us what's the timeline for some of the things that we've identified to do here?</p><p class="speaker">Dan O'Keefe:</p><p class="spiel"> Sure, Ron. Happy to. As I mentioned, by the end of November, we want to have the title framework and the delivery and leadership role refresh completed. That's going include TM training, it's going include lunch and learns, it's going include a whole series of communication events so that we can meet one on one with each consultant and make sure we communicate it effectively and answer their questions. Of course we'll need to do refinement and adjustments as we get out into the marketplace. We don't want to over-engineer it, but we want to get this information into everyone's hands so they can begin to really appreciate all those opportunities you were just talking about. </p><p class="speaker">Dan O'Keefe:</p><p class="spiel"> Then right on those heels, we're meeting again as a team face to face in another week to really talk about the performance review process and how do we make sure that by the end of the year we are ready to execute consistently across all of our business units an outstanding performance review process that really provides in a structured way the coaching and foundation for a great set of feedback for our consultants and helping them grow and expand as the year unfolds. </p><p class="speaker">Dan O'Keefe:</p><p class="spiel"> Then obviously on those heels, we're looking at what can we do to enhance the career management tools? Our expectation is to have those tools in place in the team manager's hands, in the line of service delivery leader's and competency leader's hands in the February timeframe so that they can really support this process in a very effective way on a go forward basis.</p><p class="speaker">Dan O'Keefe:</p><p class="spiel"> Then as I mentioned, we're in a continuous refinement model on a lot of the training, on the orientation, on the peer advisor program and we will be rolling those out across the business units as quickly as we can. We're piloting many of these ideas already in parts of the business and we'll be in kind of an agile, quick delivery method on many of these things as we enter 2019. So we've been talking about this for a long time. We're at the point where we're going really start deploying things pretty rapidly.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel"> Yeah, that's fantastic. I know we're picking up speed every day and I'm really excited about it. This information that we just shared, Dan, I think it helps quantify the things that are really required to roll out something like this. It's more than just kind of making an announcement and now we've done it. There's training, there are tools that have to be provided. There's ongoing management leadership time required. It has to be institutionalized, made part of the fabric of our business. That's what we're doing and also we're learning what is required in terms of an ongoing significant level of investment to ensure that we stay where we want to be with this sort of thing and we're going do that. </p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel"> Dan, I really appreciate you sharing the information, giving us some more detail. Nice job. Thanks for listening everybody. This is really important and you'll see more of this on the way soon. I'm excited about it. It's one of the ways that we set the stage for the next level of our company's development. I want us to all be part of it. Thanks for watching. </p>
