<p class="speaker">RON:</p><p class="spiel"> Today I'll be introducing you to one of our senior leaders here in St. Louis. We’ll be discussing the very important PM line of service, it’s importance to the company, and the future direction that we’re taking with this line of service. I'll also be sharing companywide highlights and celebrating some very important employee anniversaries. All this and more on today's episode of Good Day Daugherty. </p><p class="spiel"> RON</p><p class="speaker">RON:</p><p class="spiel">  Let's start with some employee anniversaries. Here in St. Louis Amy Lipp is celebrating 15 years with Team Daugherty. Congratulations, Amy. In Atlanta, Dave Hotchkiss is celebrating 10 years with the company. That's fantastic. Also in Atlanta, Kamlesh Gokal and Sujit Singh are celebrating five years each at Daugherty. Then in Minneapolis, Dora Royzman meant celebrating five years with the company and Praveen Somani and Navin Shroff from Chicago are also celebrating five years with the organization. Congratulations everyone. I really appreciate your commitment and all the great work that you've done. </p><p class="spiel"> RON</p><p class="speaker">RON:</p><p class="spiel"> Now for some highlights from around the enterprise. In Atlanta, Daugherty’s launched a strategic five-week engagement to help Home Depot assess its in-store customer service experience. Home Depot is considering a radical change to its service desk layout; opening up the area to encourage associates to interact with customers in a new one-on-one experience. Daugherty's team of Steve Kraus, Neerav Shah, Chris Woods and Ralph Lord are helping to evaluate the effectiveness of the new design and will be suggesting ideas to further drive store performance and customer experience as Home Depot looks to launch this throughout all of its nationwide locations. That sounds like a very interesting engagement. Nice work there in Atlanta. In Dallas we hired a new Client Partner Terry Longhway. Terry is digging into the AT&amp;T and Toyota client plans to identify ways to grow those clients for us. In addition, on March 1 we helped deliver a major milestone to the Crewbit program at Southwest Airlines in Dallas. Crewbit is a Southwest initiative to move their technology stack to the cloud with a March 1 deadline to migrate a large portion of their data initiatives. It was a huge success with strategic help from Team Daugherty. The customer reached out directly to compliment Brian Welty on his delivery and his major role in the success of this effort. Congratulations Brian and congratulations to the Dallas team. Just recently in St. Louis we held an annual holiday celebration; a chance to come together as a branch and celebrate all the success that we had in 2017. The event was held at the Ryse Nightclub and was an evening filled with food, drinks, laughs, and even - brace yourself for this - an impromptu dance number by me. Big fun at the St. Louis holiday celebration. In Chicago, at Walgreens we continue to build momentum in areas that are strategic for our client, one of those being in the RX Renewal area. Just recently we tapped a team of three product management consultants from St. Louis who helped form a team with the exact experience that the customer required. It’s a great example of the power of Team Daugherty. This team includes St. Louis consultants Amy VanDonsel, Jodie Wilken and Paul Parham who will be working with the Walgreens Supply Chain Product Portfolio team. Also big thanks to Daugherty consultant Frank Garrett whose relationship with the portfolio team at Walgreens helped pave the way for this opportunity. Frank has worked with these folks and helped support them over the past year. Good job team. This past week in Minneapolis, Luke Schofield and Joe Strano visited General Mills flour facility in Kansas City to talk about using Agile to help organize and execute work done at the plant. Very interesting. During the 2 1/2-day workshop, Luke and Joe covered many key concepts with General Mills leadership and by the end there was almost a unanimous agreement and excitement around implementing Agile. So over the next month Luke and Joe will be helping the plant stand up Agile teams. If things go well in Kansas City, General Mills intends to roll out Agile processes across all of its North American plants. An exciting opportunity for Daugherty as we were able to introduce a smarter and faster way for this client to work. Very interesting; leveraging Agile in a plant environment. Good job team. I continue to be very excited about our New York/New Jersey operation. You folks are doing a great job there. Really appreciate it. This last week we had Scott Stein, our new Client Partner for the New York/New Jersey area, join us, along with Terry Longhway our new Dallas Client Partner, here in St. Louis. In addition we had Coleen Finnegan, Managing Director for Dallas and Chicago and Dan O'Keefe our Atlanta Managing Director join us along with some other thought leaders and client-facing leaders from around the enterprise. We had a great four days of knowledge sharing, training and development with Terry and Scott both coming up to speed very quickly. While Scott was in St. Louis we had the opportunity to meet with all of our Team Managers and Engagement Managers at Express Scripts here in St. Louis. Since Scott will be the Client Partner for Express Scripts enterprise-wide, he’ll be visiting our Twin Cities organization and he resides in New York/New Jersey so he constantly will be communicating with those folks as well. Great work from around the enterprise. Really appreciate it. Thanks everybody. </p><p class="spiel"> RON</p><p class="speaker">RON:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel"> Today I'm here in St. Louis with one of our senior leaders, Dave Oleksa. Dave, how long have you been with Daugherty?<br /> <br />DAVE:</p><p class="spiel"> Nineteen years, Ron.</p><p class="speaker"><br />RON:</p><p class="spiel"> Around 19 years…well congratulations on that. DAVE</p><p class="speaker">DAVE:</p><p class="spiel"> Thank you very much.</p><p class="speaker"><br />RON:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel"> Let’s see…what role were you in when you joined the company?<br /> <br />DAVE:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel"> I came here as a Software Engineer and did some SAP work and things like that and have been enjoying the ride ever since.<br /> <br />RON:</p><p class="spiel"> That's great. So, what are your responsibilities today?</p><p class="speaker"><br />DAVE:</p><p class="spiel"> So, I’ve got a few things on my plate to help us keep our business running. So, as we will talk about today, I am the Project Management Line of Service leader. In addition, there are some other things I do to help with our overall branch operations. So as our Operations Manager here, the recruiting team falls under my responsibility. We have six recruiters here in St. Louis and we’re actively busy doing numerous things to make sure we’re finding great talent out there in the workplace and helping build our Daugherty brand. In addition, our operations team - primarily Diane Pfitzinger and Zach Field take care of all of our billing and revenue generation. They make sure we are collecting on those invoices and keep the cash flowing. So I help them but they're a pretty self-sufficient group. In addition to that we've done a lot over the last couple years to really sure up how we manage our bench. So I like to consider myself sometimes like our bench Engagement Manager if you will. A big part of that is making sure we find productive things for them to do on a day-to-day basis; that they feel still engaged with the company and are involved in building their skills and their careers as well as being involved in some internal projects and they’re helping our overall business operations.</p><p class="speaker"><br />RON:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel"> That's like a lot of things isn’t it? As the company grows and as we scale this and make it bigger, then it changes the dynamics around some of the things that we need to do. So let's see, how many consultants do we have in St. Louis?<br /> <br />DAVE:</p><p class="spiel"> Let’s see… we’re pushing around 475 consultants right now. RON</p><p class="speaker">RON:</p><p class="spiel"> Alright. We are targeting a bigger number by the end of the year I bet. DAVE</p><p class="speaker">DAVE:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel"> We hope to be around 550, maybe higher. We want to get to where we’ve got about 500 billable consultants.<br /> <br />RON:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel"> So our bench could range from 20 to 80 here in St. Louis.<br /> <br />DAVE:</p><p class="spiel"> Very good and you know it's hard for us to get things done when it's small, but it's certainly good for business when we’ve got everybody out generating revenue. RON</p><p class="speaker">RON:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel"> It’s interesting, I grew up in small towns where the number of people in the town was smaller than our benches sometimes in St. Louis.<br /> <br />DAVE:</p><p class="spiel"> I can believe that.</p><p class="speaker"><br />RON:</p><p class="spiel"> So just an interesting perspective there. So it's pretty important to take care of those folks.</p><p class="speaker"><br />DAVE:</p><p class="spiel"> Yeah. Having been around the office for the last couple years after coming out of Anheuser-Busch as our Engagement Manager out there, it became pretty evident to me that you could just see the morale of a bench person coming in when they didn't have specific things to work on. It's hard to drive yourself to come into work and those folks have found a lot of value in being part of things that are engaged. I’ll even put a call out to John Williams, who recently came to the bench and quickly went on to a new engagement, he gave me some direct feedback. He said, “I've never seen the bench so busy in my life. It's unbelievable how much stuff is going on.” RON</p><p class="speaker">RON:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel"> That's great. That's good feedback to get. That's very good. You know the Project and Program Management area is not a new area. There was somebody who was in charge of building the pyramids who had that responsibility probably, but it is continuing to evolve and especially in our company where we’re always looking at newer technologies and ways to leverage technology to drive greater business value. It is evolving and in fact we call it now the PM Line of Service – Project/Program Management - but I think we've also referred to it as planning and management and there are discussions as we look at our lines of services across Daugherty. They are very important to the company and I want to do even more to invest in those lines of service. We’re not going to do a full update on that on this podcast, but there will be more information coming soon in terms of more that we’re doing to invest in our lines of service at the local level, at the enterprise level…and I'm excited about it. But one of the things that we’re discussing with our PM line of service is maybe even renaming it a bit. One of the top candidates is delivery optimization, so that we can think a little more broadly and map ourselves into the future direction of this line of service.<br /> <br />DAVE:</p><p class="spiel"> Right. I especially like that name because it's my initials. But, delivery optimization really is expanding more about what we do. I think one of the key things that we look at and try to instill in folks, especially as part of recruiting and building the folks that have been here for a long time, is it's a lot more than just managing projects. It's really about being leaders out there for not only our people, but being leaders for our clients. Our Project Managers, when you think about the community, those are the folks that are really in on every bit of the business detail that's going on with our clients. They’re seeing the day-to-day, they’re seeing the business problems, and they have got the relationships that maybe a Software Engineer doesn't necessarily have with the client organization. So, as we get into things, whether it's Agile transformation or large program implementation and just even some things that are more management consulting like, our PMs are well aligned to be in those spaces, so we really need to be thinking bigger picture and holistically about what we’re doing in terms of our level of engagement and the nature of the work that our PMs are doing. It’s not just about delivering a project from A to B. RON</p><p class="speaker">RON:</p><p class="spiel"> Those are great points. Project and Program Managers and our senior leaders. Very important to Daugherty. Very important to our customers. So we want to continue to invest in those important assets and continue to develop them and also make sure that we’re leveraging those roles to provide as much value to our clients and to Daugherty as we can, because, as you mentioned, we have a great vantage point from a project/program management role to see a whole lot of what's going on with the customer and to look for ways for Daugherty to bring more value. Whether it's as simple as we’re a Project Manager managing a number of developers who all work for our competition and maybe there's something more that we could do to provide value from Daugherty, or maybe we manage 100 developers and they're all offshore. Possibly that could make perfect sense or possibly there could be a much better way to get the job done. So just looking at all those things and being part of the discussion around how we do more to support this customer. Just the Project/Program Manager position is a great place to do that.</p><p class="speaker"><br />DAVE:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel"> Perfectly positioned to do. I agree completely.<br /> <br />RON:</p><p class="spiel"> Very good. So, Dave, for this very important leadership role, how do we make sure that we’re supporting these PMs, and then let's talk a bit about the career path forward for those folks.</p><p class="speaker"><br />DAVE:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel"> Great question, Ron, and great point to bring up here because historically Project Managers are leaders and they require a lot less care and feeding than maybe some of our other people do, and you can tend to neglect them and I think we let a lot of them go on their own. So, I think there's some things we can do to really better support their careers and the opportunities, in addition to leveraging them to help us find better opportunities to do great things for our clients and find really cool great work for our people.<br /> <br />RON:</p><p class="spiel"> That’s a great point you're making and that’s one of the reasons that I wanted to do this podcast focused on the PM line of service because it is easy to take that extremely important group for granted and we love you folks out there. We appreciate all the great work you're doing. You’re very important to this company and we want to make sure that you have a lot of opportunity here at Daugherty to advance your career in the direction that you'd like it to advance. So, maybe we can talk about that because the PMs, like just about everything that we do here at Daugherty, is continuing to evolve, advance and improve. So, what are the things that we might be thinking about in terms of PM career advancement? DAVE</p><p class="speaker">DAVE:</p><p class="spiel"> So career paths are changing significantly, especially as the Agile transformations are going on.  RON</p><p class="speaker">RON:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel"> I’ve heard of that Agile thing.<br /> <br />DAVE:</p><p class="spiel"> You have? I hope everybody has.</p><p class="speaker"><br />RON:</p><p class="spiel"> It rhymes with fragile, just in case you struggle with it.</p><p class="speaker"><br />DAVE:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel"> Yes, but the whole Agile influx of everybody wanting to get on the bandwagon. The key there that we've had to learn as a whole - I have a lot of conversations with Steve Kraus in Atlanta and Darrell Andersen up in Minneapolis, and we get together occasionally and talk about things that are troubling us, and the whole Agile transformations…how do we get our people through that? We’ve got our ICAgile investment - it's been a huge investment for this organization to get not only Project Managers and Business Analysts, but our developers and others to understand the foundational frameworks of the Agile approach.<br /> <br />RON:</p><p class="spiel"> So, Dave, if I’m a PM and I'm in an Agile environment and maybe that's relatively new to me, that how do I get support? How can I think about the things that might be important for me to learn? What are some ways that I can grow? DAVE</p><p class="speaker">DAVE:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel"> Great question, Ron. So, I wish there was a really defined, perfect learning path to get people down those and the reality of it is there really is not. So many different things that they can do. You want to become a Scrum Master and if that makes sense for the next thing in your role and you can be helping manage those Agile teams that are development centric, you can certainly do that. You want to learn to be a Product Owner and what it means to help drive the prioritization in the backlog of what's going to go into the next version of that product…there are ways for us to learn that. Our ICAgile program will help a lot of our people position themselves to learn the various different things that they can serve. I would hope that in the end all of our Project Managers, whether junior or senior, can learn the tenants of all those different roles and be able to serve in many of them. It’s kind of that rock climbing wall concept of there being a lot of different things that I can do to contribute in the natural world.<br /> <br />RON:</p><p class="spiel"> Alright. There is more to come on that rock climbing wall idea. I like it a lot in terms of opening up our approach so there’s even more flexibility and multiple ways that we can advance our careers here at Daugherty. So, Dave as we’ve said, this PM role is very important to Daugherty, so if someone here has those capabilities then they’re in a good place.</p><p class="speaker"><br />DAVE:</p><p class="spiel"> Absolutely.</p><p class="speaker"><br />RON:</p><p class="spiel"> We will continue to invest in and evolve as we move forward with Agile and everything else, but that foundational competency and capability is very important to us. It is a great foundation to build on. Dave, thanks for joining me today.</p><p class="speaker"><br />DAVE:</p><p class="spiel"> It's been my pleasure. Thanks so much for having me, I never thought this day would come. RON</p><p class="speaker">RON:</p><p class="spiel"> Well here you are! Thanks for listening everybody. I’ll talk to you soon.</p><p class="speaker"><br />OUTRO MUSIC</p>
