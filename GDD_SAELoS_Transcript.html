<p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	Today we have a very exciting update on our software architecture and engineering line of service. I'm joined by some special guests to help me share that information with you. In addition to that, we'll have highlights and success stories from around the company and some very important anniversaries dates. All this and more on today's episode of Good Day, Daugherty. </p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	And now some very important anniversary dates. In St. Louis, Jeremy Weidig, 20 years. Holy cow. Congratulations, Jeremy. Scott Baird, Mark Biagi, Kevin Foley, and Mary Morales, also in St. Louis, each with five years here at Daugherty. In Atlanta, George Massey at 15 years. Congratulations, George. David Stapleton and Steve Kraus, each at five years with the company. In Chicago, Akash Patel, five years. Minneapolis, Kelly Fleisner, five years. Congratulations everyone and thanks for all your good work. I really appreciate it. </p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	Here are some highlights from around the enterprise. In St. Louis, just recently, nine of our Daugherty teammates took part in the Health Hack St Louis, a three day health focused hackathon sponsored by Express Scripts. The event brought in over 150 competitors and 20 teams with the challenge to develop an innovative health care solution powered by technology. Daugherty's nine participants were formed into two teams. One called Health Home, the other Care Circle. While both teams did extremely well, Care Circle rose above the rest and took home the $5,000.00 first prize. Congratulations to Keri Ondrus, Sean Gibbons, Tamra Berger, and Prabhakaran Chelladurai of the Health Home team, and Matt Huberty, Peter Banko, Rob Cabardo, Melissa Schrum, and Homaira Akbari of the first place Care Circle team. To celebrate a successful weekend, Daugherty sent both teams to the Cardinals game for some much deserved relaxation and fun. Congratulations to everyone for your hard work. Really good job. </p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	In Atlanta just recently, a group of our Daugherty leaders on the Home Depot client team traveled to New Orleans to participate in the Home Depot Foundation's effort to build homes for homeless veterans and play houses for their children. What a great cause. During the event, Jim Johnson and Kris Giorgetti helped build a play house for a young child named Summer. She and her family were homeless for many years before the Home Depot Foundation came to their aid. Here's a photo of Summer receiving her play house, along with Kris Giorgetti, Home Depot senior director, William Bonnell, and Home Depot VP, Naveen Krishna. Summer's family will also receive skilled training, a house they can afford, and the ongoing help and assistance as needed to become part of their community. Over 37,000 families have been helped by the Home Depot Foundation and Daugherty's a significant contributor to this charity and many other military charities across the country. Really nice. </p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	In Chicago, Lee Metcalf and Dave Hoyt recently visited our team at Walgreens to help lead a discussion with the client about how their innovation organization can better capture, evaluate, and execute on ideas that are proposed to improve Walgreens retail stores. Our Daugherty team did a great job prepping and delivering thought leadership while educating the client on our capabilities and how we might support Walgreens in testing new ideas. In the coming weeks, we'll be presenting our recommended approach as well as setting up a quarterly discussion to share the things we're seeing in the marketplace and lessons Walgreens can learn and apply in their business. Very interesting. </p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	New York, New Jersey. We're rapidly building a pipeline of future Daugherty teammates while expanding our delivery capabilities in New York to include data and analytics and application development. Consequently, we're now pursuing new local opportunities at Express Scripts around these delivery capabilities, as well as continuing to lay the groundwork for new logo expansion in New York. Great job there in New York, New Jersey. A lot more to come. </p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	In Dallas, team Daugherty in continuing to make progress at Toyota. Just recently, the client signed an MSA with us, which opens up our ability to do work at Toyota. This milestone's a significant step towards having meaningful conversations without Toyota and it's a great next step in our evolution there. I know Terry Longhway and some of our other teammates there in Dallas helped make that happen. It's a great milestone. Congratulations. </p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	In Minneapolis just recently, Gang Du and Ryan Rampersad helped the digital insights team at Cargill launch their new chicken farming app, Poultry Intelligent, very catchy, into the app store. It took four months, one trade show, a farm field trip, dozens of client conversations, and many demos and hours of hard work to make this final push into the app store. Soon customers in Brazil will be able to download the app and start tracking data on their farm. More releases are already planned for the next few months. Great work, team. </p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	Congratulations, everyone. There's so much good work going on around the enterprise. It's impossible to mention everyone so if you're out there doing great work, we really appreciate it and we'll continue to mention more and more names from our great teammates around the Daugherty enterprise. </p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	We're here today to talk about our software architecture and engineering line of service. You know, it's interesting that this line of service was one of the first capabilities that we took to the marketplace 33 years ago. It's still evolving and becoming more important than ever. We're going to give you an update on it today. Before we get started, even though you probably know these three gentlemen, let's go through some introductions. </p><p class="speaker">Jim Drewes:</p><p class="spiel">	I'm Jim Drewes. I'm the software architecture and engineering line of service lead for the enterprise. My role is to support the software engineers that we have across all of our business units and in the local line of service leaders that we have in each one of those markets to help build a stronger software engineering capability.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	That's great. You know as our line of services continue to grow and evolve, it becomes increasingly important to connect our subject matter experts, our thought leaders, our practitioners across the entire enterprise. Even though we deliver locally, we can support each other and we do every day. In your enterprise role, you can help ensure that all the pieces are coming together. </p><p class="speaker">Jim Drewes:</p><p class="spiel">	That's exactly right. </p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	All right. That's great. Thanks, Jim.</p><p class="speaker">Dave Hoyt:</p><p class="spiel">	As many of you know, my name is Dave Hoyt. I lead our business advisory IT management consulting and enterprise COEs. That includes the agile transformation COE which is obviously central to this topic. I also work pretty closely with Ron on any new capabilities that we're bringing into the business. These capabilities we're getting ready to talk about we're always refreshing and adding more into so I'm excited to join you here. </p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	Yeah, Dave, you and I have made a good team over the years in terms of go to market, content, and I've enjoyed that working relationship. We've taken a number of new capabilities to the marketplace and continue to do so. </p><p class="speaker">Dave Hoyt:</p><p class="spiel">	Absolutely. We're continuing to do that right into the software engineering space. </p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	All right, very good. </p><p class="speaker">John Wirth:</p><p class="spiel">	My name is John Wirth. I'm in an enterprise sales and delivery operations leadership role. I get the opportunity to work with the managing directors, the client teams in all of our markets, making sure that we're tapping into the capabilities of across the company and proactively bringing them to our clients in a thoughtful manner. </p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	Yeah. John, you're a major part of the operational mechanism that keeps the company running. </p><p class="speaker">John Wirth:</p><p class="spiel">	Thank you. </p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	Very much appreciate that. Okay, so software architecture and engineering, continuing to evolve. Jim, give us an update on what's going on.</p><p class="speaker">Jim Drewes:</p><p class="spiel">	Software architecture and engineering has grown substantially in the last few years. We have just reached the milestone across the enterprise we are now exceeding 300 engineers and architects in all of Daugherty. It's a very substantial number of engineers to have these days. We're focused on a lot of new technical areas in the line service. 33 years ago when we started, it was a VAX VMS shop. </p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	Oh, those were the days. </p><p class="speaker">Jim Drewes:</p><p class="spiel">	Sadly, we don't do too much VAX VMS anymore, but we've had to build new capabilities along the way. Right now, we're heavily focused on agile and DevOps but also we're doing a lot with cloud and cloud architecture. Now that more organizations are embracing the idea of putting applications into the cloud, we now have to come up with new software architectures that help support the different capabilities of those platforms. </p><p class="speaker">Jim Drewes:</p><p class="spiel">	We've got a lot going on with that. In Dallas, for example, we're training up a dozen engineers on AWS because we do a lot with AWS, Azure, Pivotal Cloud Foundry. Here in St. Louis and up into Minneapolis, Express Scripts uses Pivotal Cloud Foundry pretty heavily, as does Monsanto. We're doing some new work with Azure right now with FinLocker here in St. Louis as well. We're very focused on building training and looking for opportunities to get engaged in more of those sorts of technologies. </p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	That's great, Jim. Growth, new technologies, training, developing our people. That's what opportunity is all about, isn't it? </p><p class="speaker">Jim Drewes:</p><p class="spiel">	Yep.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	Very good. Very good. Let's talk about some success stories around the enterprise. John, if you don't mind, could you help us with that?</p><p class="speaker">John Wirth:</p><p class="spiel">	Let's go to Atlanta. Recognize the Cox communications team. There's a ... As they enhance the capacity of the network, they have to go through a planning process and establish the bill of materials. Our team has automated that entire process and have taken it from two to three weeks of effort to two to three minutes. </p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	Wow.</p><p class="speaker">John Wirth:</p><p class="spiel">	With incredible enhanced accuracy. Talk about a business case and success story, right there is a very big deal. Happens to be the first engineering team and piece of work we've done at Cox and we've done really well. Now, we're doing more and more work. Our team is essentially the product management team as well as the solutioning team. I would like to just really call out and recognize Ajay and Mo, Ajay Bahukhandi and Mo Abolfathian for the good work that they've done in Atlanta.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	That sounds like a great way to get started if that was our first SA and E engagement there. Fantastic. </p><p class="speaker">John Wirth:</p><p class="spiel">	Wonderful. </p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	Sounds like we might have some more. </p><p class="speaker">John Wirth:</p><p class="spiel">	We will.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	Very good. </p><p class="speaker">John Wirth:</p><p class="spiel">	Good, good. Let's go to Dallas. Jim just mentioned the investment in angular and AWS for Southwest. Southwest is a real important customer doing some strategic work. Proud of the team there. Colleen is helping us make sure that we're investing and preparing the team to just continue to lead the way for Southwest, our teams and their employee teams. Over the next couple of months, we'll have invested in angular training, AWS training for a couple of dozen employees. </p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	Oh, that's great. </p><p class="speaker">John Wirth:</p><p class="spiel">	Just a real nice job by Kurt Parten for leading the way and driving that planning and training process, with some support from the other markets including Mike Taylor here in St. Louis. </p><p class="speaker">Jim Drewes:</p><p class="spiel">	Mike Taylor's contributions to that Angular training we're starting to bring into Atlanta as well. He's talking to Sharma Vedula in Atlanta to try to bring more of that angular training into that market as well. </p><p class="speaker">John Wirth:</p><p class="spiel">	Great, great. If we were to go up to Chic-</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	That's great there in Dallas. Dallas is growing every day. That's still a significant percentage of the team there ... </p><p class="speaker">John Wirth:</p><p class="spiel">	It is. </p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	... that's gone through training and new technologies. That's great. </p><p class="speaker">John Wirth:</p><p class="spiel">	Yeah, that's right. If we were to go to Chicago, Allstate as a strategic customer and a part of their business is around Allstate roadside assistance, we have been working on an application that enhances the leadership team's ability to run the business. We built a management dashboard that provides greater analytics, enhanced reporting around the KPIs to run the business. As we've done that, we've also provided leadership in the Jira and DevOps leading practices. Not only are we getting work done, but we're helping to elevate the competency of the employee's teams along the way. Wonderful job there by Mary Turczynski and Khajana Kumar, with some support from Dan Sung. Nice work for the team there at Allstate. </p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	That's a great combination for us here at Daugherty, isn't it? Helping the client get the work done and teaching them and helping them grow at the same time. </p><p class="speaker">John Wirth:</p><p class="spiel">	It's at the foundation of our repeat referral work. </p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	Yeah.</p><p class="speaker">John Wirth:</p><p class="spiel">	It's just a wonderful example there at Allstate. </p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	Knowledge transfer, that's a key.</p><p class="speaker">John Wirth:</p><p class="spiel">	Yeah.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	That's great, good. </p><p class="speaker">John Wirth:</p><p class="spiel">	Let's look here in St. Louis. Rabo AgriFinance, a big lender to the agricultural business sector and they've been a good customer for quite some time. We're nearing the end of their digital transformation around vendor financing so we have major releases here at the end of the May and then again in the latter part of July. Just want to recognize and thank the team for doing such a tremendous job there. We've got four engineering teams. They're really helping to transform how they connect with their consumers and then the origination process of loans, making it easier, more streamlined, a friendlier process, and shortening the origination time from eight weeks or more down to days or hours. Just improving the overall experience of the customer. </p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	Yeah, great job by the team there. John, you, Dave, and I just had lunch with a couple of senior leaders from Rabo, didn't we? Including the president here of North America. </p><p class="speaker">Dave Hoyt:</p><p class="spiel">	The president and one of the leaders in the strategy part of their business. Through the good work that our team has really done over the last period here with the vendor finance transformation, it's enabled us to really be their preferred strategic exclusive partner for the next big transformational effort around their affluent customers, direct lending. The next piece of work will be the highest end strategy work, customer journey mapping, business process optimization, defining new processes. It will lead to the next period of engineering work for our teams. We expect it to be the next two to three years and probably something around 25 engineers in total.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	That's great. That's great. The excellent work of the team was called out a number of times during our lunch by the senior leaders there at Rabo. We did great work so the customer asked us to do more work. I just love that. I love when that happens. It happens all the time here at Daugherty. Great job every one. Keep it up. It's the foundation upon which we build everything else. Great job. </p><p class="speaker">Dave Hoyt:</p><p class="spiel">	There's four engineering teams working there now and lots of names to call out. I do want to recognize a few folks that I think are doing really well in providing some leadership to the team. Drew Walters, Mike Albair, and Laura Thomas. </p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	Very good.</p><p class="speaker">John Wirth:</p><p class="spiel">	Great. If we were to go a little further north into Minneapolis, the AmeriPride team has a done a wonderful job. AmeriPride is in the linens and uniform business of positioning, selling, as well as then servicing, cleaning. They recently were bought by Aramark. Our customer's gone from a couple billion to 18 billion in size and it's really helped position Daugherty with a larger enterprise. The specific pieces of work that we've done recently in the engineering space was to enable their mobile workers. The workers that are out there taking care of their customers out in the field. Route delivery drivers, sales people, service people. We're using mobile computing platforms to help them do their job better so when they're out in the field they can get more work done. They're out there pricing and negotiating, quoting new situations, they can have guidelines on their mobile devices. We've digitized that piece of work for them. </p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	I love mobile workers. Lots and lots of them because it's such a great opportunity for technology to enhance and improve everything that they do, make their lives easier. John, this acquisition that you mentioned, which has basically created a much bigger, even much bigger customer for us to work with, I think you were telling me that some of the great work that we did and the technology that we've developed and put in place, helped make that merger happen. </p><p class="speaker">John Wirth:</p><p class="spiel">	It did, it did. In fact, just a couple of weeks ago, we were sitting with one of the leaders of the new organization and he was sharing with us his plans and how to take the work we've done and expand it into the rest of the Aramark enterprise. </p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	Yeah, that's fantastic. You know, that's just an extension of the story. Every thing is built on doing good work. Sometimes when we do good work, we help our customers succeed and in this case, the entire corporation, to achieve a success that benefits them and creates more opportunity for us. </p><p class="speaker">John Wirth:</p><p class="spiel">	Yeah, so great shout out to Catherine Beck and the engineering team there. We really appreciate their great work. </p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	Wonderful. </p><p class="speaker">Jim Drewes:</p><p class="spiel">	There's some other interesting things about that particular engagement as it pertains to the technology side of everything as well and the new capabilities that we continue to develop as a line of service. We've talked a little bit recently about the rock climbing wall of roles that our people play and how there's a little bit more cross over between the lines of service. One of those cross over areas is in SA and E with data and analytics. That particular engagement leverages a lot of Kafka and there's a strong Kafka architecture behind that piece of software in addition to it being Xamarin mobile solution. We're seeing a lot more Kafka across data and analytics and software architecture and engineering. The Kafka part of it is one of the things that they really want to distribute and test out with this application to see if they can distribute it more in their enterprise. </p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	Great. </p><p class="speaker">Jim Drewes:</p><p class="spiel">	Daugherty consultants are leading the way. </p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel">	Great. Excellent. Thanks, Jim. There was so much good ground to cover today that our podcast went a little long. I've decided to break it into two episodes to make it a little bit easier for all of you to consume the wonderful content. In two weeks, we'll be back. I'll provide more company highlights and then we'll have the second half of this podcast. Thanks for listening everyone. We'll talk to you soon. </p>
