<p class="speaker">RON INTRO:</p><p class="spiel"> Hello everybody today we will be doing a demo of some very interesting software that we've developed for Express Scripts; software that helps Express Scripts manage through their very critical pricing process. In addition to that, I'll be sharing some highlights from around the company. There are a lot of good things going on. I'll be touching on a few of those. All this and more on today's episode of Good Day Daugherty. RON</p><p class="speaker">RON:</p><p class="spiel"> I'm going to quickly do a high-level review of a number of bright spots from around the company. In the Twin Cities we completed a prototype for the Cargill Animal Nutrition group. It’s a mobile app that helps Cargill understand and track better pricing data for Cargill as well as competitive products. We pulled this prototype together quickly, which is a great Daugherty capability - I love when we do this - and now the prototype is going to be moved into production. Also in the Twin Cities, Luke Meyer has introduced a new format for our account team meetings, Lean Coffee. Lean Coffee allows much greater participation and input even as to the content of the meeting from the participants, the team members. This is something that I am interested in hearing more about and it looks like it could be a good approach for us. In New York/New Jersey we achieved a milestone. We've added our 20th team member to that team. I love you guys in New York and New Jersey and keep up the great work. In Atlanta we’re doing some great work on the Store of the Future program. I think at Kris Giorgetti helped us get a foot in the door there and is leading the land and expand charge from Daugherty. I’m really excited about that. We’re making great progress at Cox. I was just on the phone with some of our Cox leadership today. Love the progress we’re making and we’re helping launch and to find the video transformation program. A number of things that we’re involved with there at Cox Our Dallas Account Manager Tricia Mearkley deserves a shout out here because she managed to not only get all the contractual details pulled together, but actually got us on the preferred vendor list for GlaxoSmithKline which is a big deal. Nice job Tricia. In Chicago our United Way innovation event that we did with and for the United Way of Lake County was a big success and a number of of senior business people were there. We were able to help this very worthy cause - helping underprivileged kids learn how to read - as well as continuing to build the Daugherty brand in Chicago. In fact, Lee Haskell has helped us identify a potential artificial intelligence opportunity at Motorola. Then at Allstate we have some new wins there. We won a competitive bid over Slalom for a strategic business intelligence initiative as we continue to build our VI Information Management capabilities in the Windy City. Helping us achieve that nice win were Lee Haskell, Kurt Janvrin, Greg Becker and, our newest employee in Chicago, Srini Gajjala. Off to a great start, Srini, and great work everyone all around the Daugherty Enterprise. I really appreciate it. </p><p class="spiel"> BRAD</p><p class="speaker">BRAD:</p><p class="spiel"> Yeah. My name is Brad Wyckhouse. I've been a Daugherty just over a year now and I’m a tech lead on the project. We’re running a full stack project with Java, SpringBoot on the backend and JavaScript on the front end. We have a six-person team. RIC</p><p class="speaker">RIC:</p><p class="spiel"> My name is Ric Comana. I’m the Scrum Master on the team. I’ve been with Daugherty for six years now. I’ve been at various clients including Emerson, Anheuser-Busch, Charter and now Express Scripts.</p><p class="speaker"><br />RON:</p><p class="spiel"> Really good. That's great. So we’re going to do something a little different today and add a little more structure here to how we work and how we we cover things for this demo. If you have something you think would be good to share with the rest of the company, this might help you put a little more structure around it. We’re going to talk about the business context and then spend some time on how the application works with a couple of scenarios and then we'll talk about the Daugherty differentiators, or the Daugherty benefits and advantages associated with this work. So let's start with the business context. If you don't mind, Ric, could you share with us a bit of the business situation? RIC</p><p class="speaker">RIC:</p><p class="spiel"> Okay, so Express Scripts provides the best prices for their clients, and their clients being some of the so the big companies like Boeing, Coca-Cola and McDonald's. Some of the cost savings that they pass on to their clients, and I believe Brad has some examples. BRAD</p><p class="speaker">BRAD:</p><p class="spiel"> Yeah, so they have a few different ways that they will achieve value for their end consumers. These big companies will buy pharmacy benefit services or management services in order to keep the costs low for the end consumers that are benefiting from these drugs and therapies. For example, Daraprim, that was a big story back in 2015. A man named Martin Shkreli bought the only manufacturer of this drug and jacked the price from $13.50 a pill all the way up to $750 a pill and Express Scripts, due to their leveraging some of their relationships with other drug manufacturers and pharmacies, are able to work with a compounding pharmacy to develop this drug for $1 a pill. So they actually lowered the market price for the whole country and actually were able to get more value for their customers. RON</p><p class="speaker">RON:</p><p class="spiel"> What a great story that is. So they helped create an alternative going from $13 to $750 per pill. That's a bit of a shortsighted view isn’t it? That was very profitable for a short period of time and then everybody goes to jail. BRAD</p><p class="speaker">BRAD:</p><p class="spiel"> And it made the news in a dramatic fashion. So another way that they drive values just to their economies of scale…so right here in St. Louis, up by the airport, they have a pharmacy, which we also have other Daugherty teams working in the pharmacy technology area, but this pharmacy is a huge, automated, robot-controlled factory that in in the words of one of the vice presidents “will turn out more prescriptions in a single morning than corner Walgreens will do all year.” RON</p><p class="speaker">RON:</p><p class="spiel"> Good! So great job covering business context. Why don't we take a look at how the application supports those business processes? RIC</p><p class="speaker">RIC:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel"> Okay, so in demonstrating what our application does, this is the homepage which pricers and approvers come to. So what we're seeing here, on the right-hand side, is pending approvals. So, for example this one from major US manufacturer Boeing, the Director would come into it and take a look at it and there's various reports that they could look at. Some of the key information on the top here is the number of lines for this particular proposal, this is the specific one that they're talking about. So they might be for a commercial deal and in the annual number of prescriptions so if this is for 3,500 employees, they are forecasting 50,000 prescriptions per year for that user base. Another thing they can take a look at is in the pricing details. This is where the approval would come in. They could glance through all the various metrics and there's a lot of pricing details here, financial details, etc. Once they have looked it over and are ready for approval, you click on this “Approve” button. So you click on that and if there's any comments you want to put in you can put it in that area, and its approved. Now you can see that the status is actually changed to being offered and that's it. If you come down to the very bottom you can take a look at the approval section and there is a history of who did the approvals and you can see that this was approved by me just a few minutes ago.<br /> <br />RON:</p><p class="spiel"> Okay, very good. So you can follow-up and see where things are in the process. If there's a question you know who to go back to to pick up the conversation.</p><p class="speaker"><br />RIC:</p><p class="spiel"> That's correct. Some of the approvals might have multiple levels and each proposal can have, based on the pricing size. have multiple levels of approval needed or just one. So each Director has their own approval authority level – so it would be one level of approval or multiple levels. RON</p><p class="speaker">RON:</p><p class="spiel"> So what these managers are trying to figure out is, okay, if this is the price is it competitive enough so that we can win this bid. We want to win the business but we want to do it in a manner that is profitable. They'll be looking at things like the multi-year costing scenario because they might offer Boeing, for example, an opportunity to pay Express Scripts far less than Boeing is currently paying to cover healthcare. Then Express Scripts will make sure that all the services are delivered at that committed to price. RIC</p><p class="speaker">RIC:</p><p class="spiel"> Correct. That’s the life of the deal column that you’re actually seeing here on the screen.</p><p class="speaker"><br />RON:</p><p class="spiel"> Good. So it could be that Express Scripts might not be profitable the first couple of years while they put some things in place that will drive cost out of the equation, and then it'll be more profitable at the end. So they’ve done things to drive cost out of the system, offer savings to the customer, and make a profit themselves over the course of the contract. So, you’re tracking all that needs to be understood by the managers in the approval process. RIC</p><p class="speaker">RIC:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel"> Exactly right. So if I go back to the homepage, you can see that the one approval letter that I have is gone. The second piece that they’re seeing on this page is called win/loss feedback. So that was another gap that we filled with this application. After the contract is actually submitted to their end-user clients Boeings, McDonald’s, etc., there was no feedback coming back to the system stating whether they won the deal or they lost the deal. If they lost the deal they can put a few details in there as to why they lost it. So the next time if they're doing another deal with the same clients, they can see the details such as they missed it because the rebates weren’t good enough. So they can try to sweeten the deal a little bit. So this information is also being captured in our system.<br /> <br />RON:</p><p class="spiel"> That’s very important. RIC</p><p class="speaker">RIC:</p><p class="spiel"> Finally, the last piece I wanted to show today is called the Mass Forecasting Dashboard, and I won’t go into the details of all these reports, however they use this for pricing details, for rebate details, and this is what I was talking about earlier for the entire company. So they model things with little percentage discounts across the board for their budgeting or strategic plan. They can take a look at pricing as a pricing file is generated, a rebate file is generated, and there's what is called an outlier file that's also generated, and that’s just abnormalities that might not fit into the rules. So they can be aware of those too.</p><p class="speaker"><br />RON:</p><p class="spiel"> Okay. BRAD</p><p class="speaker">BRAD:</p><p class="spiel"> So we have some rules that we built into our application to look for abnormal situations in the data. For example, a three-year contract that only has two years worth of pricing data. We can flag those in that outliers report so that when they're doing their strategic forecasting or their strategic planning and budgeting, they’re able to to kind of get a sense for the accuracy of their estimates. RON</p><p class="speaker">RON:</p><p class="spiel"> That's a great example, thanks Brad. Okay, very good. Really helpful tool right at the core of the business for Express Scripts. So how many folks did we have on the team? RIC</p><p class="speaker">RIC:</p><p class="spiel"> So it is a team of six and what's very unique about our team is that we actually are here in the Daugherty - St. Louis Dev Center and we have two employees that are Express Scripts employees. So the benefit that we bring to the client on that is twofold. One is we don't have the overhead of being on site, but the bigger benefit is that we’re incubating these two employees and teaching them what it's like to develop on a Scrum team. Secondly, they’re learning how to code in the application so long-term they can support the application.</p><p class="speaker"><br />RON:</p><p class="spiel"> That's great. Transferring knowledge, developing capability for the customer, creating a more stable environment, and getting real work done at the same time.</p><p class="speaker"><br />BRAD:</p><p class="spiel"> I would say one thing on our team, it's been really key having us driving at a very high velocity. The way we have been able to do that is by having a really good team. So, in particular, two of our Daugherty teammates, Marcus Loman and Curtis Meuth, actually started on the team before I did and I was able to hit the ground running because they really make my job easier because they both work really hard and they're showing to Express Scripts just what is it means to be dedicated and focused and produce with high output. So it's been great. We’ve gotten a lot of kudos from senior directors and vice presidents as a result. RON</p><p class="speaker">RON:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel"> That's excellent. Well congratulations on a successful application. Is this work still in progress?<br /> <br />RIC:</p><p class="spiel"> Yes, there is actually a second application we’re already building in the middle of and there's 1/3 one on the backlog that they would like us to build too. RON</p><p class="speaker">RON:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel"> That's excellent. You know there’s a really important point here and as I look at these demos and talk to the teams, I see that there's a lot of good thinking here in terms of how this work maps into the business process. So, just as you were describing earlier, given that what are some other things we could do that would integrate with this, that would help other elements or components of the business process. That's a good way for us to be really effective professional consultants and go to the customer and offer additional ways to help. Wonderful. Nice job. Thanks for joining me on the podcast today Ric and Brad. Super job. Thanks for listening everybody and we’ll talk to you again soon.</p>
