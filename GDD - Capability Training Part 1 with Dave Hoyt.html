<p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	This week we'll be introducing some Daugherty training and support that will help you become an even better professional consultant, advance your career here at Daugherty and deliver even more value to your customer. All pretty darn good things. Really excited about it and we have the penultimate segment of the Great Daugherty podcast contest ... You might need to look that word up, penultimate. I know I had to ... Plus some very interesting company highlights. All this and more on today's episode of Good Day Daugherty.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	And now for an update on some of the exciting things that are going on around Daugherty. In Minneapolis, we'll be launching our first ever Daugherty University class in the coming months. A culmination of an extensive recruitment process that included five college campus visits, over 200 student introductions and 20 invitations for our initial testing and interviews. We were so pleased with the level of professionalism and talent that we extended 10 offers and all 10 offers were accepted. The new Daugherty University class will kick off January seventh in the Twin Cities.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	Just recently, the Atlanta Development Center has formed a team dedicated to the evaluation and implementation of innovative technologies for the Home Depot, partnering with the Loss Prevention and Store Operations Group at Home Depot, our Daugherty team is focused on helping deploy technologies such as RFID, facial recognition, in-store traffic monitoring into select retail stores. The team is now supporting multiple products and the flow of requests from Home Depot for more evaluation shows no sign of slowing down.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	I was very happy to attend New York, New Jersey's first ever business unit meeting, an all-hands meeting. We had a great evening. I really enjoyed spending the time with everyone. Had a number of great conversations, shared some stories from the early days of how Daugherty got started. And then talked about, the vision and growth plan for the New York, New Jersey business unit. It took me several hours to get there. It was a rainy day. Flights were backed up, but one good thing came out of it and that is I flew into New York, New Jersey at night. It was raining, the city, the entire metropolitan area was lit up and I can see how much opportunity is there. It's huge. Gave me goosebumps.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	And so I'm very committed to working with our great team on the ground in New York, New Jersey, and building out a tremendous amount of opportunity. In fact, we'll have at least a thousand consultants in the New York, New Jersey area. You can write that down if you'd like. And I'm really looking forward to it. Thanks everybody for holding down the fort there in New York, and for all the great work that you've done and we're going to build on that success in a way that creates more opportunity for all of us.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	Just recently in Dallas, Columbus Brown and Conrado Morlan represented Daugherty on the local and the international speaking circuit. Columbus was invited to speak at Agilecamp in Dallas giving a talk about aligning your products to the corporate strategy. Conrado took the Daugherty presence to an international level as he was invited to speak at the PMO chapter in Nuevo León Mexico, giving a talk about Agile. I'm proud of Columbus and Conrado and these are great opportunities for us to establish ourselves as thought leaders to meet people in the market and to share how our capabilities can help solve any business need.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	Every year in St Louis, we support the United Way of Greater St Louis through our giving campaign. This year has exceeded all expectations. The number of participating Daugherty employees increased by nearly 40% and the dollar amount pledge doubled over 62,000. I'm very proud of the giving culture here at Daugherty and the extraordinary impact of the United Way organization. So I'll be matching contributions made dollar for dollar. So between the proceeds raised through our giving campaign, our battle of the bands, our famous Chili Cook-Off and our matching program, we've collectively raised over $130,000 for the St Louis Community. That's wonderful. Thanks everybody.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	Just recently our data and analytics team in Chicago delivered a Tableau project for the Chicago Police Department. And I've heard that the Chicago Police Department could use a little help and I'm really proud the Daugherty team stepped up to provide that support. The goal of the project was to set up an environment to allow the police department to share crime data with citizens, to allow site visitors to look at heat maps filtered by types of crimes, and see multi-year trends by area of the city and police beat.  Special thanks is due to the St Louis branch for their help, especially Jonathan Lee. John jumped in on short notice to help the team successfully deliver the project and did a great job with the Tableau leaders at the police department. Already the client has asked Daugherty to support them as they expand their Tableau usage across additional teams. I really love engagements like that. Great Work, interesting technology, good for the community. So many great things going on around Daugherty. Really proud of you folks. Keep up the great work and I'll talk to you soon.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	As we continue to look at ways to scale and grow the organization, creating opportunities that we can make available to all of us, I'm really excited about some of the tools and the support mechanisms we're putting in place to make that easier and more achievable and one of those tools that are most excited about is capability training. I have Dave Hoyt with me today and Dave if you don't mind just introduce yourself. I think most everyone knows who you are, but let's do that.</p><p class="speaker">Dave Hoyt:</p><p class="spiel">	Sure. Once again, Dave Hoyt, I've been with the company almost 20 years now and really responsible for delivery quality and all our high end strategy services and COEs as well. I've also over the years helped us build out our capabilities as a company, which is really what we're here to talk about today.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	Yeah. Fantastic. And I understand you put together a series of videos on capability training?</p><p class="speaker">Dave Hoyt:</p><p class="spiel">	Yes. We're really excited to talk about the rollout of a new refreshed version of our capability training and our solution crafting training that we're going to be rolling out starting right away.  That training is really going to be very instrumental as our consultants look to make sure that they're delivering the right value to their clients and they're participating and contributing to CSA squared.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	Yeah. Wonderful. Wonderful. And so how many videos are there, Dave?</p><p class="speaker">Dave Hoyt:</p><p class="spiel">	So there's 14 videos. In fact, we've chosen to change the way we're delivering the training this time. So it really is a new format, new approach. There's 14 videos. Each video can be viewed on demand. There are anywhere from six to 10 minute videos and that allows you to walk through our capabilities. That will be the first aspect of the training. Then it's followed by an in-person, trainer-led course, and that class is about a three hour class. The first hour is focused on questions that you may have related to capabilities based on watching the videos. And then the last two hours are focused on solution crafting role plays.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	Wonderful, wonderful. So kind of a three part thing here, sneak preview today and then the videos which will be made available to everyone next week?</p><p class="speaker">Dave Hoyt:</p><p class="spiel">	Yes that's right.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	And those videos are a prerequisite for the classroom training so everyone will have the benefit of seeing the videos, they can put their questions together comments, ideas, even start thinking about how though those capabilities that they've learned about might matter to the engagement that they're on and the customer that they're working with, and then bring those two face to face class where you'll cover capabilities but also get into solution crafting?</p><p class="speaker">Dave Hoyt:</p><p class="spiel">	That's exactly right. Yes, and so we're going to be providing everyone a notes form to be able to fill that out as they're watching the videos to capture the key questions you may have or maybe perhaps opportunities that you think of that could relate to your current client situation.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	Dave, you already touched on this, but it's such an important point. I want to just want to build on it a little bit more and that is, why capability training matters. Why does it matter, if you understand Daugherty capabilities or not? Maybe you're a great program manager or good software engineer or a great data analysts. Well, why would need to know what Daugherty does outside your engagement? That's really, really an important question for us. And what do you think Dave?</p><p class="speaker">Dave Hoyt:</p><p class="spiel">	Sure. I see the need for this every day as I'm out working with consultants. Very often, I see and this may be a kind of a strange analogy, but I see our consultants out there chopping down trees with a hatchet and another Daugherty consultant, right next door has a chainsaw. They could help them. And so in that analogy, part of what we're looking for is to make sure we all understand what tools in the toolbox we have to work with. And as you can imagine, that's critical to make sure that you're doing the best job for your client. You're delivering the greatest value for that client. It's also a very critical component of CSA squared. As we understand how we can, Daugherty can add more value to that client situation.</p><p class="speaker">Dave Hoyt:</p><p class="spiel">	And then finally, I think as a professional consultant, it's just an essential peer part of what we do. You have to understand whether you're bringing the right capabilities to the table. To be a true professional consultant, you need to be bringing all the capabilities that we have as an organization.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	Oh, they're such great points. Sometimes I'll still run into a question or a discussion around, well, how is it we differentiate ourselves from staff augmentation or contract labor companies? Well, this is one of the ways we do it. Well, first of all, we're smarter than they are, but in addition to that, we bring 34 years of experience in a couple of weeks, 34 years of experience lessons learned across dozens and dozens of fortune 500 companies, leading practices, tools, methods, techniques, and the more of those things we understand more value we can bring to our customer, the more we can differentiate ourselves as professional consultants and our organization as a professional consultancy.</p><p class="speaker">Dave Hoyt:</p><p class="spiel">	Yeah, that's so true. And I see it as a differentiator between the way we work and the way the big global firms work as well, because while they may have high end practice leads that have all that information and know how to apply it, they don't always cascade that down to every consultant and every consultant here at Daugherty really should have the power of the collective 1,100 people and all that experience. That in my mind is the way I think about team Daugherty. Is every consultant has that power and so that's part of what we're doing with this training is working to equip everyone to be able to identify those situations where a tool could make sense and you may not be a complete expert at the end of the training, but you'll at least know enough to be able to reach out and get support and get help as it relates to that area.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	That's wonderful. Dave would it be possible to do a little bit of a sneak preview trailer at this point? Let everyone kind of envision what's available to them?</p><p class="speaker">Dave Hoyt:</p><p class="spiel">	Sure. So here's a quick sample of what you're going to see as part of those videos.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	All right.<strong>[Capability Trailer plays]</strong>Ron Daugherty</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	Wow, that's some really great stuff. Nice job on that, Dave.</p><p class="speaker">Dave Hoyt:</p><p class="spiel">	Thanks. And I know it can be overwhelming. So the good news is that we have some techniques to make this simpler to digest and to apply and through the class you'll learn a little bit about one of those techniques. It's called the skeleton key approach. So I'll just leave you with that teaser and you can watch the videos to learn more and we'll be covering that quite a bit in the training. But we want to focus on a couple of our core foundational competency areas today, just to give you a little bit of a sense for what's in the video. So let's talk about data and analytics for just a moment.</p><p class="speaker">Dave Hoyt:</p><p class="spiel">	If you look at our professionals across the company, over 40% of our consultants have some data and analytics experience-</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	Wow.</p><p class="speaker">Dave Hoyt:</p><p class="spiel">	... and we've been doing a lot of great work in that area. We've helped over a dozen companies move to next generation architectures in that data and analytics space, working all the way from strategy through to realization of that work through implementing those technologies. And there's a lot of great examples out there. We'll share more in the videos, but Monsanto is a great example where we are supporting and helping to migrate all the record data platforms globally with our team of about 80 consultants and collaborative managed team model, collaborative managed services model over to that new mode to infrastructure. And that's for what was Monsanto, and now is Bayer, through the acquisition.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	That's a great example. When you mentioned that I'm so proud of that bear team because our group, that large group managed the mode one earlier technology and then proved that they were Daugherty profiles by quickly learning mode two, the new technologies and becoming leaders in that space. That's a really great success story, good job on that.</p><p class="speaker">Dave Hoyt:</p><p class="spiel">	So a lot of great capabilities there and that positions us to be able to do enterprise information strategies. It allows us to be able to help clients really put in place new levels of analytics and business insights as well as allow them to do all the core data foundational work required to support that. So that's a great, great key area for us. The other key area we'd highlight would be software engineering as well. You could argue that's right where the business started and has always been a central piece of what we do here at Daugherty.</p><p class="speaker">Dave Hoyt:</p><p class="spiel">	We have a lot of great capabilities in that area as well, all focused on leveraging emerging technologies and in many cases delivering very mission critical applications where all the company's revenue flows through those applications. And through those capabilities we've continued to help companies is also adopt agile techniques and agile practices and the most current software engineering processes. As we go through this, what's fascinating is our teams are often recognized, so teams like Express Scripts we helped them with the pricing database initiative. That team was recognized as being six months of head of all the rest of their software engineering teams in terms of agile adoption or maybe it's a Cargill with immersive learning center and the work that we did around turkey tracking, which is especially relevant this time of the year-</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	It sure is.</p><p class="speaker">Dave Hoyt:</p><p class="spiel">	We helped use Blockchain technology to allow a consumer to be able to look up where their turkey was produced and actually see videos from the grower, the farmer who raised that Turkey. So some very exciting work in the software engineering space. One of the things that's also really exciting is the work we've done to establish a unified development center and there's a lot more detail and the capability training around this, but I'll leave you with this last key point that's very important. As we began to look at normalizing the output of these teams and comparing the productivity of our teams to offshore teams, what we've been able to see in the detailed analysis is anywhere from a 19 to 65% cost advantage with our Daugherty dev center or Daugherty onsite teams as compared to offshore developed.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	Love it. I love that. I love our development center. Our development centers are around the country, our unified development center I think is how we think of it and the market place conditions are such that software engineering it's growing, it's exploding in terms of the need that's out there because companies need to actually build capabilities, not just plan and think about and talk about but actually build. So at some point you got to write code, develop software and then create something and that's happening to a tremendous extent. Just everywhere now.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	And so understanding what Daugherty's capabilities are and how we might be able to help our customers and all of them are needing to build capabilities and we're really good at it. And we have things like our development center and our agile center of excellence and other things like that to help us. That's a big part of what this capability training's all about, isn't Dave? Understanding what matters to our customers and then understanding what capabilities Daugherty has that maybe we could bring to bear to help.</p><p class="speaker">Dave Hoyt:</p><p class="spiel">	Yeah, that's exactly right. That's a perfect segue to a little bit of what we'll cover in the next podcast. We'll talk a little bit more about our other foundational capabilities. We'll talk a little bit about delivery leadership and business alignment. We'll also spend some time talking more about the skeleton key and we'll also talk quite a bit more about solution crafting, which is really that core concept of how do we take all these great capabilities and turn them into highly relevant, handcrafted, tailored solutions for our clients. So more to come on that.</p><p class="speaker">Dave Hoyt:</p><p class="spiel">	Hopefully as we've talked this through today, you're all sitting on the edge of your seats wondering how do I enroll in the class? How do I get access to the videos? So the good news is there'll be a video coming or an email coming shortly and the email will share with you how to access engage to both get access to the videos as well as to enroll in the classes.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel">	That's fantastic Dave and what a treat, a two part podcast on a really fun topic and something that's good for all of us. So thanks for watching and stay tuned for our next podcast coming out soon.</p>
