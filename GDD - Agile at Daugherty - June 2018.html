<p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">           We have a very interesting podcast today, focused on Agile. You don't want to miss this one. Plus well be doing company highlights and success stories from around the Daugherty enterprise. All this and more on today's episode of good day Daugherty.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">            And now for some company highlights. Just recently in St. Louis a group of over 600 Daugherty team mates, clients, friends and family came together at Bush Stadium for the 6th annual Cystic Fibrosis First Pitch. Daugherty's use the Cardinal's First Pitch opportunity year after year, to help raise awareness about this life threatening disease. This year, Matthew Sperruzza joined me on the field, Matthew's 10. He took the mound, and delivered an outstanding first pitch. While a cure for Cystic Fibrosis doesn't exist at this time, significant advancements are being made, and we believe there will be a cure within our lifetime. </p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">            This would not be possible without you, and your contributions as Team Daugherty. And I'll tell you a quick story, Matthew's father told me that because of the continuing advancements toward a cure made possible by the support being given to Cystic Fibrosis, and he thanked Daugherty very much for what we're doing, he said because of those advancements, he expects that Matthew will live a normal life, a full life expectancy. And that's what this is all about. Thank you all so much. </p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">            In Minneapolis Daugherty was called on once again, and our own John Hanson took an enormous challenge in helping Cargill lead their upgrade of open text. Open text is Cargill's enterprise document repository, and workflow solution. And is a critical component of many software applications used across the enterprise. John and the Cargill team faced enormous challenges and risk, as they had to ensure quality and support for existing applications, while deploying the upgrade. I'm happy to report they did it seamlessly. This was truly a no news is good news scenario. Team Daugherty delivered without any complaints, just kudos.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">            Earlier this month in Dallas a group of nine Daugherty Team members, along with friends and family, volunteered at the North Texas Food Bank, to pack boxes of food for senior citizens in the community. Over the course of the day, our Daugherty Team packed 480 boxes of food. The equivalent of 11,667 meals. Thanks to Kashmira Kittur, and Srini Kavuru, for leading this initiative, and to the rest of the Daugherty Team members that help support our community in Dallas. In Chicago, Daugherty was a sponsor at the 22nd annual McDonald's Technology Charity Classic at Cog Hill Golf and Country Club. Through the event Daugherty helped the Ronald McDonald House Charities of Chicagoland and Northwest Indiana raise money to offset lodging costs for families needing to be close to their children receiving treatment and medical care. Daugherty Team members spent the day with McDonald's leaders and a few other McDonald's friends you might recognize. What a wonderful cause.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">            Earlier this month our New York Business Unit sent a team to run in the local Spartan obstacles race. The race was a three and a half mile obstacle course, that sent our Team Daugherty consultants running ,climbing and crawling over obstacles, as well as going up and down a 1200 foot mountain, three times. Congratulations to Gene Paolucci, Steve Evans and Lorenzo Outar for competing the race and making us proud. </p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">            In Atlanta our team at Genuine Auto Parts has successfully completed the pilot for the NAPA Express Program, which they've already rolled out in 66 store locations. The NAPA Express Program is Genuine Part's next generation ordering platform. Allowing store employees as well as customers to more easily locate and purchase special order parts. Future enhancements for the program will help to continue to enhance the customer experience and drive additional growth in NAPA stores across the country.

Congratulations to the entire team, and thanks so much everyone for all the great work you're doing.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">            Over the last several weeks, as we've discussed each of our lines of service, one topic has come up every time. That topic is Agile. So we're gonna go deeper on Agile today, and have two guests to help me, Terry if you and Dave don't mind, please introduce yourselves.</p><p class="speaker">Terry Mork:</p><p class="spiel">                  Thank you Ron, my names Terry Mork and I am the Agile Community of Practice Lead across Daugherty,</p><p class="speaker">Dave Hoyt:</p><p class="spiel">                   And my name is Dave Hoyt, I lead a lot of our Agile teams but also have responsibility for our Agile COE, and our Agile Community of Practice.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">            Very good. Well why don't we just get caught up on where we are with Agile. Dave if you wouldn't mind.</p><p class="speaker">Dave Hoyt:</p><p class="spiel">                   Sure, really excited to be here today to talk about this topic, it is something that I believe has come up through many of our previous podcasts, across the other lines of service, and it's an area that we're really accelerating our capabilities and our momentum in this space. It's also an area that affects almost all our consultants in some way shape of form. So this is really an important podcast for us. What we thought we'd do today is just talk a little bit about where we're at today with Agile, where we're headed tomorrow, because we have a very unique vision around what role Agile will play here at Daugherty, and then also talk a little bit about how we're going to get there.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">            That sounds perfect.</p><p class="speaker">Dave Hoyt:</p><p class="spiel">                   Great, so perhaps to get us started, let's talk a little bit about where we are today with Agile. We've been doing Agile work for a long time here at Daugherty, it's been a big part of the way our development teams have been operating in the dev center, and at our client locations. But beyond that, Agile has really been a big part of the Daugherty DNA for a long while. If you really think about the core values that we have as a company, and Agile, as well as the Agile principles, they line up very well. </p><p class="speaker">Dave Hoyt:</p><p class="spiel">                   We talk about being customer centric, well at the center of the Daugherty has always been very focused on delivering exceptional client value. We talk about network versus hierarchy, well Daugherty has always been a very entrepreneurial organization, with a great disdain for bureaucracy that doesn't add value. And then if we talk a little bit further about how that relates to how we deliver value back to the client, and empowered teams, what we see is that our vision and our approach around CSA squared and our client teams line up really well with this idea of empowered teams. So it's really right at the heart of the Daugherty DNA, as we go forward.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">            Very good. Agile's just at a perfect position now isn't it, it's impactful, it's significant out there, with respect to delivering business value and an important behavioral component to how companies get work done, and everyone is trying to understand how to leverage this relatively new thing, as effectively as possible. So they need help using it, and they need help understanding how to incorporate it into their business more effectively. So it gives us the opportunity, just as you said Dave, to help them get work done, and also help them understand what this thing is, and how to best use it. Which is exactly where we want to play.</p><p class="speaker">Dave Hoyt:</p><p class="spiel">                   Yes, that's absolutely true, and as we've had some big successes with our clients, we're also getting stronger and stronger with our own internal capabilities. We've had some big successes there as well and Terry, maybe you can share some of those successes.</p><p class="speaker">Terry Mork:</p><p class="spiel">                  Yeah I mean internally in Daugherty we've had a lot of good successes. We've really scaled up our Scrum Masters across the enterprise to over 200, so since last summer we've scaled up our coaches to over 40, and about four or five enterprise level coaches across different clients that we have. We've started up a Scrum Master Community, we've really scaled up different working teams that we have within our community practice, and really gotten some good things done. We've also really worked on our training and development as well, so we're in the middle of developing some Advanced Agile Training, that happens to be certified by ICAgile, which is really big in the industry right now, making a big stance. So we've completed five tracks within that ICAgile program and we're working on four with still many more to come, that we want to get done.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">            That's great progress, and some really impressive milestones achieved there, over 200 Scrum Masters did you say?</p><p class="speaker">Terry Mork:</p><p class="spiel">                  Yes.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">            Wow wonderful. More and more Agile coaches, the training and development is so important for us, for a number of reasons. It's just part of our vision, and business model to hire talented people and invest in the development of those talented people. But especially for something that is relatively new, growing, evolving, impactful like Agile, for us to ensure that our folks, our subject matter experts have the best, most useful training and development tools available to them. Really important.</p><p class="speaker">Dave Hoyt:</p><p class="spiel">                   And in fact that's been so powerful for us that in many cases clients, ans they learn more about it, are interested in participating in our training. And so we're really looking at how we can selectively begin to provide that to our clients as well.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">            Excellent. </p><p class="speaker">Terry Mork:</p><p class="spiel">                  Yeah so I mentioned the community of practice, we have five different teams that are getting very involved. We've got a business development and thought leadership track. We've got continued training and career development, we've got the Scrum Master Community which I mentioned before and overall we have something that a lot of our clients are asking for, is moving from a tradition PMO to an APO, to an Agile Portfolio Office. That's really resonating with a lot of our clients right now, so that's one track that we're really focusing on going forward.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">            Excellent. So it sounds like a significant number, maybe even most of our employees are interacting or impacted by, participating in Agile in one manner or another.</p><p class="speaker">Terry Mork:</p><p class="spiel">                  Yeah that's exactly right, so it's at the heart of our DNA that it's cross ... Cutting across all of our consultants, in all of our lines of business.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">            Yeah excellent. So we want to be able to do it well, and we want to be a thought leader. We want ... It's just never been our mission to be a follower. Always to be a leader. And for a lot of reasons. And it's one of the ways we can bring the most value wherever we interact with our customers, by being able to execute and bring thought leadership as well.</p><p class="speaker">Dave Hoyt:</p><p class="spiel">                   And that really is shaping our vision for where we're going with Agile. And I believe that we have a very unique vision, and the ability to build something very special here at Daugherty.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">            I like that, I like the sound of that Dave.</p><p class="speaker">Dave Hoyt:</p><p class="spiel">                   If really is, it's very exciting and I think there's a couple things that are really important to know about that vision. And so first of all, we're really serious about embracing the Agile principles for the long run. And so while we believe that years from now we may not be talking about Agile a lot, because it'll be like electricity, it'll just be part of our day to day lives, and what we do. The reality of it is, it's not a passing fad. It's something that we will be embracing for the long run. </p><p class="speaker">Dave Hoyt:</p><p class="spiel">                   And beyond that, the way we go after it is a little bit different, and a little big unique. We're going to continue to have just a relentless focus on the business results. And a very pragmatic approach around the way we do Agile. We're going to continue to be solution neutral. And in may cases we're seeing the need for hybrid frameworks and hybrid solutions. So that means that we're not going to be dogmatic or really rigid in the way we apply our Agile techniques. And then furthermore beyond that, we're looking for sustainable change for our clients. So our ability to use techniques like the integral model, to be able to drive that sustained change is going to be very important.</p><p class="speaker">Dave Hoyt:</p><p class="spiel">                   And what that means for our consultants, our professionals is, we're going to play a little bit different type of role than what we see out there in the marketplace. So first of all our consultants are not gonna be just purely catalytic coaches, they're going to be proactive advisors to our clients. They're not going to be just purely Agilist, they're going to be interested in providing holistic solutions to our clients, using all the tools in the Daugherty toolbox. And that's going to be very important to us as we move forward.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">            Now wait a minute Dave, and you telling me that our consultants are not only going to be Agilists, but also professional consultants?</p><p class="speaker">Dave Hoyt:</p><p class="spiel">                   Absolutely.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">            What a powerful thing. What a powerful thing. And one of the ways that I think of it is Agile, by itself is a powerful dual process approach, Agile combined with common sense and business acumen, in the form of true professional consulting is unstoppable in its ability to add value. So I think that's what were talking about here.</p><p class="speaker">Dave Hoyt:</p><p class="spiel">                   That's absolutely right, and I think what were building is maybe a little bit more difficult to build, it's different than what we see with a lot of our competitors, but ultimately it will become extremely powerful, and our ability to support our clients, and we'll become unstoppable as we're successful in building this.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">            That's kind of our way here isn't it, we don't really go for the easiest approach. We go for the best. And it's a little harder to get there, but when we do, it really provides the greatest level of value possible.</p><p class="speaker">Dave Hoyt:</p><p class="spiel">                   That's absolutely right. And you see that in the way we're structuring our approach to Agile and how we're going to get there. Because the easy way to go would be to stand up a separate line of service around Agile, but we've made the very deliberate decision, because we anticipate that Agile will permeate everything we do, all our lines of service, that we have made the decision to really position it as a Community of Practice, that all line of service participants can be involved in. And that really leads us into how we're going to get there, and the Agile Community of Practice, so Terry would you like to tell us a little bit more about that?</p><p class="speaker">Terry Mork:</p><p class="spiel">                  Sure. So yeah thank you Dave. So our Community of Practice, we're really trying to instill inclusivity, so it's open to all our consultants, across every branch. So our Community of Practice is, we've identified leads in each of our branches that are coming together, that are working in their own branch, in their own line of service, but also coming back from the enterprise perspective for Daugherty, so we're all talking the same talk, we all see the same vision, we may get there a little bit differently, but if we are collaborative across Daugherty enterprise, we'll be very successful.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">            That sounds great Terry, what's next?</p><p class="speaker">Terry Mork:</p><p class="spiel">                  Thank you Ron. So I want to open this up as an invitation for all our consultants, cause we are promoting inclusivity, so our Community of Practice is open to everyone. And I want to invite everyone to get involved. Look for more communication coming out, we've got a newsletter that's coming out, we're going to have branch specific Community of Practice meetings, either a webinar or Dave and or I will actually be at the local branches to give this message as well. So a lot more communication coming out, want to encourage everyone to get involved in your branch or in the enterprise Community of Practice. We've got all of our capability teams that I've mentioned, and more to come with that as well. And then finally, everyone can look at their own role and reflect on how do we bring the vision that we've talked about here to life across Daugherty?</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">            Alright, very good. So Agile's time has come. It's important to our clients, it's important to Daugherty, we're making tremendous progress here thanks to all of you thanks to our leaders, and there's much more to come. And as you've heard today, the combination of Agile plus professional consulting, common sense and business acumen, is absolutely unstoppable. </p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel">            Hey thanks for listening we'll talk to you soon.</p>
