He’s also a board member at two local non-profits:</p><p class="spiel"> The Father’s Support Center and the St. Louis Area Foodbank. This past week, Andre was recognized for his work, both at the office and in the community at an awards banquet hosted by the St. Louis Business Journal. Congratulations Andre, we’re proud of you!Moving on to Chicago, at McDonald’s, we were recently asked to provide an approach for agile transformation as well as an enterprise roadmap. Based on the initial positive feedback from the client, we’ve been asked to prepare and present a detailed proposal to execute the work outlined in our approach. We are pulling in enterprise thought leadership including Dave Hoyt and Ken Mersmann from the ES&amp;P team, as well as Terry Mork from St. Louis and Ram Rajamani from New Jersey as we move forward with this very strategic pursuit.In Minneapolis, at Medtronic, our project team has successfully launched the Regulatory Reporting Ad-hoc Universe. With this release, the reporting system will now provide access to comprehensive data and reports – something they did not have before. Users will now be able to extract data for many specific purposes, including the generation of specialized reports, license expiration/renewal tasks, amongst many other things. Special thanks to our Daugherty teammates who helped make this happen</p><p class="speaker">In Minneapolis, at Medtronic, our project team has successfully launched the Regulatory Reporting Ad-hoc Universe.

I’m happy to announce we’ve just hired a client partner for New York/New Jersey. Scott will start with us in two weeks, but he’s already engaging with the company. He’s coming to St. Louis this weekend to join us in our support of the heart ball, which is the the big gala fundraiser for the American Heart Association. The chairperson for this event is Tim Wentworth, who's the CEO for Express Scripts, which of course is one of our most important clients in the New York/New Jersey region. But Scott will have — Scott Stein is our new client partner’s name — and he'll have an opportunity to meet Tim Wentworth, the CEO, and a number of other leaders from Express Scripts just this coming Saturday night. In addition, we’ll be hosting our first ever business unit meeting in early April. Great things are happening in New Jersey. Good job, team! And thanks everybody for all the excellent work you're doing around the Daugherty enterprise. Great job.</p><p class="spiel">I'm here today with two of our MarCom teammates. The MarCom organization at Daugherty is an interesting group. We’ve had a marketing group for many years. Mostly that group was focused on helping with some internal communications, some early brochures and sales material we had as a company. But over the last few years, the MarCom organization has evolved significantly, and now has a number of capabilities that can be used to support you at your client site, and also as a direct service and offering to our customers. We’re going to talk about some of those things, the evolution of the MarCom group and some of the capabilities available to all of us. Let's start with some introductions. If you don't mind, Chris, let's get us started.</p><p class="spiel">CHRIS PASSMORE</p><p class="spiel">Sure. Hi, I’m Chris Passmore. I’m a visual designer for MarComm. I handle most of the aesthetic aspects of projects and some layout of web content.</p><p class="spiel">JOHN HARTMANN</p><p class="spiel">And I'm John Hartman. I'm kind of the team lead of the marketing communications group. Also, I want to give a quick shout-out to Aaron, who’s often behind the camera but maybe now in front of the camera. And then as well, Anna Cole, who has been married recently, Anna Duncan now. You might see emails come through from her. She sends out the newsletter weekly. And Jake Russell as well, who is another content writer with us. So that's our team right now.</p><p class="spiel">RON DAUGHERTY</p><p class="spiel">JOHN HARTMANNSure, I love to talk about this because there's so much stuff that's going on in MarCom right now. There's so much growth that we've had over the last 12 months. I just get really excited about this kind of stuff. So MarCom, if you're not familiar, it's not a guy named Mark with the last name Om; we’ve had a couple of people who have looked in the directory to find Mark. There's no Mark Om; it’s marketing and communications — so smashed together. We are an enterprise resource at our core, and our chief focus is kind of in client team support. And that manifests itself in several different ways. One of those ways is through business development support</p><p class="speaker">Sure, I love to talk about this because there's so much stuff that's going on in MarCom right now.

There's no Mark Om; it’s marketing and communications — so smashed together. We are an enterprise resource at our core, and our chief focus is kind of in client team support. And that manifests itself in several different ways. One of those ways is through business development support:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel"> so things like presentation design, case study development, success stories; artifacts that go into those, things that we present to clients and then also on more strategic pursuits:</p><p class="spiel"> custom pieces — so things that, a lot of times, tell a big story have a lot of information that might be complex and we help boil that down and present it like a showpiece that we present to an executive.RON DAUGHERTY</p><p class="spiel">Good, good. So on that, for example, if someone was putting together a presentation — an important presentation — and they wanted to make sure it had the best professional look and feel, they could contact you, John?</p><p class="spiel">JOHN HARTMANN</p><p class="spiel">Absolutely.</p><p class="spiel">RON DAUGHERTY</p><p class="spiel">And you could brainstorm with them about ways that MarCom could help?</p><p class="spiel">JOHN HARTMANN</p><p class="spiel">Absolutely, and I would say the earlier the better. Because that's where we kind of excel, where our differentiator is. It’s being able to take that complex and technical information and help boil that down into something that is clear and relatable. So it's more than just window-dressing. It’s helping to kind of figure out the best way to tell the Daugherty story, and to highlight our capabilities in a certain area.</p><p class="spiel">RON DAUGHERTY</p><p class="spiel">That's important.</p><p class="spiel">JOHN HARTMANN</p><p class="spiel">Yeah, absolutely. So the second bucket that is a main focus for us, too, under the enterprise support is bringing thought leadership by way of a unique capability. So those unique capabilities could be something like UI design, which Chris is kind of our leader in that space.</p><p class="spiel">RON DAUGHERTY</p><p class="spiel">And Chris, I know you've done some really impressive work. That SAMCOM initiative was your work, wasn't it? The design and the user interface associated with that?</p><p class="spiel">CHRIS PASSMORE</p><p class="spiel">Yeah, so based on preferred direction from the client, I was able to do some layouts for the team so that could get developed into the iOS app.</p><p class="spiel">RON DAUGHERTY</p><p class="spiel">JOHN HARTMANNSo two other kind of main capabilities at least that we’re called on for a lot right now — aside from UI design — video and, you know, graphic design, which kind of goes a bunch of different ways</p><p class="speaker">So two other kind of main capabilities at least that we’re called on for a lot right now — aside from UI design — video and, you know, graphic design, which kind of goes a bunch of different ways:</p><p class="spiel"> making things look good and kind of telling that story visually. And then thirdly—RON DAUGHERTY</p><p class="spiel">Sorry to interrupt, John. That’s so important because I think everyone knows we've had industrial-strength software development capabilities for many, many years. Then we’ve done some good user-interface work, but we've really taken it to the next higher level now. And as we’ve pointed out in an previous episode, we’re able to compete very effectively with well-known marketing firms. And we can cover the marketing user experience area at least as well as they can, and then do a much better job on the technology side. So great differentiator for us.</p><p class="spiel">JOHN HARTMANN</p><p class="spiel">Absolutely. And then kind of the third main bucket that falls under that enterprise and client team support is helping to grow and deepen our relationship at client sites through strategic engagements. So some background on kind of what those engagements look like…a lot of where we come in is what you could kind of, at their core, place as internal communications. And Daugherty is well-positioned for going after this type of work, because we have embedded teams; we know our client so well. And MarCom is well-positioned to actually execute on that work, because, as I mentioned, we’re good at taking a lot of that technical information that's processed through the IT organizations and telling that story in a really relatable way. And what it does is it helps show another side of Daugherty, and it fills a specific client need as well, and it helps us become more sticky. You know, it just adds another tool to the tool belt.</p><p class="spiel">RON DAUGHERTY</p><p class="spiel">This is a really interesting on to me, and I’ve seen it develop up close a couple of times now. Change management is such an important part of what's necessary to drive major new initiatives and transformations forward. Transformation is a word we hear every day out there in the marketplace, and so we’ve been able to step right up to the plate with our MarCom organization and offer the client some capabilities to help them with their change management, their internal communication, even buy-in from senior leadership that the investment being made is really worthwhile and help those senior leaders understand what the investments are really all about.</p><p class="spiel">JOHN HARTMANN</p><p class="spiel">You nailed it kind of right on the head there. So at A/B specifically we’ve kind of seen this relationship evolve because we've — over the last, I would say, 12 to 18 months— we delivered on about a half-dozen projects that are, you know, client engagements there. And along the way we've been introduced to new areas of the business areas where Daugherty might not have been engaged currently at that time/new directors that we’ve been introduced to. And a lot of our work ends up bubbling up to senior leadership. So where we’re usually dealing with this is at that Senior Director VP type of level but then they’re using that to showcase, “Hey, look at what my department’s doing” to all their bosses and senior-senior leadership. So it's a great way to get Daugherty’s name in front of the top of the organization.</p><p class="spiel">RON DAUGHERTY</p><p class="spiel">JOHN HARTMANNYep, and so we've we've received a lot of positive feedback. I think we’re helping Daugherty’s brand and image at the client sites we’re at. You know, with this last video that we presented to the senior director — his comments after watching the video were “I love it; it hit on all the points that I thought were key points, and it really told that story, but, you know, I'm not surprised, because everything you guys have produced for me has just been top-quality/top-notch.” And I felt like that was the best reward, you know, of all to hear</p><p class="speaker">Yep, and so we've we've received a lot of positive feedback.

So he was surprised and really pleased, but at the same time, he knew what he was going to get.RON DAUGHERTY</p><p class="spiel">Very nice. Congratulations for that. That's excellent. Do you have any other examples that you'd like to show?</p><p class="spiel">JOHN HARTMANN</p><p class="spiel">Yeah, just real quickly, I'll show you. We had talked about business development support. And on strategic kind of efforts, we sometimes develop custom pieces that tell that story that help take complex data information and boil it down. So this is a booklet that we produced for Charter. And we’ll probably show this on the screen.</p><p class="spiel">RON DAUGHERTY</p><p class="spiel">So you worked with the Charter client team?</p><p class="spiel">JOHN HARTMANN</p><p class="spiel">Yes, with Dave LeBlanc and Diallo here in St. Louis. Our kind of engagement managers an account leads for Charter.</p><p class="spiel">RON DAUGHERTY</p><p class="spiel">JOHN HARTMANNYeah, they needed some assistance, because what they had were these large Visio diagrams with arrows pointing every which way. And it was really hard to follow and especially coming in at a VP level, which is where they were talking about this transformation</p><p class="speaker">Yeah, they needed some assistance, because what they had were these large Visio diagrams with arrows pointing every which way. And it was really hard to follow and especially coming in at a VP level, which is where they were talking about this transformation:</p><p class="spiel"> to show a VP that picture and have it be succinct and make sense. We produced this, and they used this in their pitch, and the VP at Charter was so impressed that he asked to take a copy of this and use it to show his management and use it as the showcase piece — the pitch of why they needed to fund this multi-million dollar project.RON DAUGHERTY</p><p class="spiel">Very nice. That’s great. Good work on that.</p><p class="spiel">JOHN HARTMANN</p><p class="spiel">Thank you.</p><p class="spiel">RON DAUGHERTY</p><p class="spiel">What about those handsome statuettes there I see on the table?</p><p class="spiel">JOHN HARTMANN</p><p class="spiel">Oh yeah, I brought a couple of friends along with me. I got Martha here and Penelope, we’ll just say.</p><p class="spiel">RON DAUGHERTY</p><p class="spiel">Let me see Penelope there. Very nice. So were these your names.</p><p class="spiel">JOHN HARTMANN</p><p class="spiel">I just made them up.</p><p class="spiel">RON DAUGHERTY<br /></p><p class="spiel">Ok.</p><p class="spiel">JOHN HARTMANN</p><p class="spiel">I guess that will be their official names because now we got it on the podcast. So you know, much (like the rest of Daugherty), a lot of our work isn't public-facing; it’s proprietary and confidential to our clients. So when we’re build out this capability, we wanted to be able to give some meat behind a claim that we can do good things. And so that's where these came in. One of them is for print design. So you know, something like the Charter brochure is an example of print design. And then video productions. So those are the two areas where we won these awards to kind of go out and say, “We have a multi-award-winning marketing department that can handle everything from print and presentation to video production and so on and so forth.”</p><p class="spiel">RON DAUGHERTY</p><p class="spiel">CHRIS PASSMOREYeah, I just want to encourage everyone</p><p class="speaker">Yeah, I just want to encourage everyone:</p><p class="spiel"> Don't just think of us as print-, video- or presentation-focused. For instance, if you need a quickly-spun-up prototype to help you with the presentation, we've done that in the past for Mary Kay. It went off very positively. Use your imaginations when you want to include us in on something.RON DAUGHERTY</p><p class="spiel">That's a really good point, Chris. And I'm familiar with the Mary Kay work that you referred to. The client client had worked with a number of firms — technology and marketing firms — and the comment back from the client after seeing the prototype was “You guys get us and understand our business better than anybody else that we’ve worked with.” That's how strong and positive an impression that prototype made. How long did the team work to develop the prototype?</p><p class="spiel">CHRIS PASSMORE</p><p class="spiel">RON DAUGHERTYFive business days and a tremendously powerful differentiator and positive impression with the customer. Thanks for mentioning that, Chris. That's something that everyone can think about in terms of — even in pursuit of an opportunity — to put a prototype together. And that approach</p><p class="speaker">Five business days and a tremendously powerful differentiator and positive impression with the customer. Thanks for mentioning that, Chris. That's something that everyone can think about in terms of — even in pursuit of an opportunity — to put a prototype together. And that approach:</p><p class="spiel"> a prototype visually showing the customer what the application can do will become a more and more common and important part of the selling business development process in the future. That's a prediction — a prediction from me. This is a great example of it. Even at some stages of the lifecycle of a program that we’re working on that might involve a prototype could be very useful.CHRIS PASSMORE</p><p class="spiel">Exactly.</p><p class="spiel">RON DAUGHERTY</p><p class="spiel">JOHN HARTMANNYeah, that's at its core what we want to do</p><p class="speaker">Yeah, that's at its core what we want to do:</p><p class="spiel"> just think about ideas, come up with creative ways to address problems and — really, where we need the assistance in the field would just become spotting a situation where we might be able to jump in and we can help and take it from there.RON DAUGHERTYLove it, love it. Creativity/innovation is at the core of our business. So Chris, John, thanks so much for joining me. Aaron, over there in the corner, thanks for all your help as usual. Thanks for listening, everybody, we’ll talk to you soon</p></p><p class="speaker">Love it, love it. Creativity/innovation is at the core of our business.
