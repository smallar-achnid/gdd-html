<p class="speaker">RON:</p><p class="spiel"> We have a very interesting topic today - Daugherty University - plus a number of company highlights. All this and more on today's episode of Good Day Daugherty. </p><p class="spiel"> RON</p><p class="speaker">RON:</p><p class="spiel"> A number of really interesting and successful things are going on around the Daugherty Enterprise. Let's start with Chicago. We had a great success with the Walgreens Central Retail Signs project. Praveen Somani was asked by a Senior Manager at Walgreens to help manage a difficult project that had been languishing since 2014. Walgreens had been attempting to replace their legacy sign system used to print price tags and promotions, name badges, store hours, and other things in favor of the new cloud-based solution. So using Agile methodologies and principles, Praveen reorganized project teams and instituted monthly releases, and then later transitioning to bimonthly releases as the project matured. Most recent release, just last month in November, was deployed to all 8400+ stores in time for the holidays. Pretty big deal due to the success of these releases. The legacy system has been completely turned off in over 1300 stores and the the rest will be retired in the first quarter of 2018. Great job in Chicago. Great job Praveen. One of our highlights in St. Louis was the United Way campaign. The United Way is a great organization we support. As most of you know I'm on the United Way board here in St. Louis and this year's campaign was a tremendous success. Between the campaign pledges, the chili cook-off, the raffle, and the Battle of the Bands participation with the Daugherty band, we increase our giving over last year by nearly 30% and the number of employees participating increased by 35%. We raised over $38,000 through campaign pledges alone, which Daugherty is happy to match dollar for dollar. So, over the course of just two and a half weeks Team Daugherty raised a total of over $85,000 for the United Way. And the St. Louis United Way is one of the most successful United Way organizations in the country, and we raised over $75 million this year in total here in St. Louis. I think there were even a few folks outside of St. Louis that contributed to this campaign. We really appreciate that from everyone. The primary driver of this year's campaign was Maribeth Bendick, with a lot of help from Jayme Halpin, Lee Metcalf and Karen Dupske. Thanks so much for your leadership driving the campaign. I'm very pleased with the progress that we've made in Atlanta over the last several months. We’re growing the business, bring new teammates on board, winning new opportunities, and positioning ourselves even more strategically. It's been a real team effort. Our Client Partners, Engagement Managers, Team Managers, Line of Service leads, and all of our teammates in Atlanta; I really appreciate your good work there. Dan O'Keefe is one of our Client Partners who joined the company several months ago and I am delighted to promote Dan to the Managing Director role in Atlanta. Always great to promote from within and really pleased with this situation. So Dan will continue to operate as Client Partner on the Cox account, but will be our overall Managing Director in Atlanta as well. Great job Dan! Congratulations, and great job everybody in Atlanta. Really appreciate your good work there. In Minneapolis the Daugherty team helped Best Buy achieve Black Friday success. Black Friday in retail is the biggest, most critical business day of the year and this is especially true for our customer Best Buy. So this past Black Friday Daugherty consultants played a critical role in holiday coverage by helping support all aspects of Best Buy.com and their browse to buy capabilities. Best Buy was hailed by Business Insider as a major winner on Black Friday. Data saw over $5 billion in online purchases. So congratulations to the Daugherty team lead Nicole Manes and to our group of Bas, Developers and Scrum Masters that helped Best Buy have a great Black Friday. Good job. In Dallas Conrado Morlan stepped up at Southwest Airlines at a critical time during a complicated release of the Hometown Base Project. He handled all changes and release details, allowing it to go off without a hitch. The Hometown Base Project will allow crew members to reduce their commute time during assignments. Southwest Airlines implemented this as a pilot in a few cities just this month, and they're expecting to include more locations in January. Congratulations Conrado. </p><p class="spiel"> RON</p><p class="speaker">RON:</p><p class="spiel"> I love today's topic; it’s Daugherty University. We have one of our leaders of the Daugherty University initiative, as well as as two of our great graduates of Daugherty University here today. So let's start with some introductions. MATT</p><p class="speaker">MATT:</p><p class="spiel"> Hi my name is Matt Henroid. I’m a Line of Service leader here in St. Louis. I've been working at Daugherty for the last nine years and I help run our Daugherty University program here in St. Louis. RON</p><p class="speaker">RON:</p><p class="spiel"> That's great, Matt. Thanks. STEPHANIE</p><p class="speaker">STEPHANIE:</p><p class="spiel"> I’m Stephanie. I graduated from the Daugherty University program. I started here in August. Now I’m a Scrum Master for the Anheuser-Busch IOS development.  RON</p><p class="speaker">RON:</p><p class="spiel"> Wonderful. Thanks Stephanie. CALE</p><p class="speaker">CALE:</p><p class="spiel"> My name is Cale Riggs. I went through the recent Daugherty University class with Stephanie and I'm currently in the Dev Center here as a developer on the Monsanto Price Publishing team.</p><p class="speaker"><br />RON:</p><p class="spiel"> Alright. Fantastic. So, Matt, let's just get started with an overview of what Daugherty University is. You know one thing of the things that's interesting here is that it's important for all of us to understand about Daugherty University is that even if you might not be a potential student in Daugherty University, you might be one of the instructors or leaders that we could call on, or you might know somebody who could benefit from participating in the Daugherty University program here in a way that would be good for them and good for us. So that is great and I just really love what we’re doing with Daugherty University. If you wouldn't mind, Matt, just tell us a little more about it. MATT</p><p class="speaker">MATT:</p><p class="spiel"> Sure. So Daugherty University has been a program that has been around for many years and has been used for several different lines of service, so it's not only available from the SA&amp;E Line Service. We use it to bring individuals into our organization that have skills and the aptitude to be Daugherty Consultants, but may not have the experience or the technology background to be on a team right away.  RON</p><p class="speaker">RON:</p><p class="spiel"> You made a great point. You're one of our SA&amp;E leaders, so you're mostly involved with the SA&amp;E oriented Daugherty University sessions, but we do sections across all of our lines of service. MATT</p><p class="speaker">MATT:</p><p class="spiel"> That’s correct.</p><p class="speaker"><br />RON:</p><p class="spiel"> Okay good. So it gives us a chance to bring in high aptitude, smart Daugherty profiles who might not have all the experience or skills yet and then give them a boost in terms of training and just it just helps them accelerate their development. So how long is a Daugherty University session? MATT</p><p class="speaker">MATT:</p><p class="spiel"> The program is seven weeks long and consists of a variety of technical, as well as soft skills training, that are are necessary for our consultants.</p><p class="speaker"><br />RON:</p><p class="spiel"> Okay great. So how do we teach these classes? Do we bring in instructors? MATT</p><p class="speaker">MATT:</p><p class="spiel"> Yeah absolutely. So it is a variety of online training as well as on-premise training and we couldn't do that without our two dozen different instructors and consultants that participate in the process. RON</p><p class="speaker">RON:</p><p class="spiel"> Good. So it's an opportunity for some of our folks to get some teaching experience in a controlled Daugherty setting. MATT</p><p class="speaker">MATT:</p><p class="spiel"> Yeah definitely.</p><p class="speaker"><br />RON:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel"> Very good so online instructors, classroom instructors and…is there a project as well?<br /> <br />MATT:</p><p class="spiel"> Yeah absolutely. So one of the key components of the program is a final project where the consultants are able to use the skills that they have learned during that seven week program and adapt and put them to the test. RON</p><p class="speaker">RON:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel"> Yeah that's great, and I remember in this last Daugherty University session the team did a great project and asked for me to come in to see the the demo of the project. Cale, you and Stephanie and the rest of the team did a great job. Just real quickly if you don't mind, Stephanie, remind me what was that class project?<br /> <br />STEPHANIE:</p><p class="spiel"> So we did the Daugherty Deck, which is a baseball card-like viewing of all of the consultants here at our branch. It’s currently at our branch and hopefully at our other branches soon as well. Just to put a face to a name for the consultants. It was a really great project that we all worked on together. This was the first time that all of the Daugherty graduates worked on one project. RON</p><p class="speaker">RON:</p><p class="spiel"> Okay good. What was your role on that project? STEPHANIE</p><p class="speaker">STEPHANIE:</p><p class="spiel"> Cale and I both tried to…not necessarily be the leaders…but determine direction and pull the team together.</p><p class="speaker"><br />RON:</p><p class="spiel"> That’s great. Well, let’s talk about that because it is such a great opportunity for you to work as a team. Cale was there support available to you during the project from Daugherty teammates?  CALE</p><p class="speaker">CALE:</p><p class="spiel"> Absolutely. Starting with the DU team, the other Daugherty University people on the team, there were a lot of skills and a lot of strengths in place by then so we relied on one another and we were able to find the strengths within the team, and then when we were struggling with something we really relied on a lot of the consultants in the Dev Center. They were really eager and willing to help us out and really give us the time to either work through a technical problem or understand a large-scale concept. They were very helpful. RON</p><p class="speaker">RON:</p><p class="spiel"> That’s good. I really enjoyed the product you developed, because as the company gets bigger it is harder to keep track of people and where they are. This is a nice reminder of the face and the name together. So, that is really helpful. Let's talk a little bit more about the content of Daugherty University. So in terms of the curriculum we have the technical training here and just tell us a little bit about …pick an example of some of that training and give us more information about that, Matt. MATT</p><p class="speaker">MATT:</p><p class="spiel"> Sure. So our training is focused both on technical and on soft skills. On the technical side, one of our consultants in our line of service, Rob Cabardo, came in and taught a three-day class on JavaScript, HTML and CSS, to teach our consultants the best way to create professional websites. RON</p><p class="speaker">RON:</p><p class="spiel"> Yeah that's great. So, as far as the the participants and the students in Daugherty University, they don't just walk in off the street and say, “I want to be in the class,” and we show them the way. There's a fairly rigorous process that we go through isn't there? There's a fairly rigorous process isn’t there?  MATT</p><p class="speaker">MATT:</p><p class="spiel"> Yeah there’s a fairly rigorous process for Daugherty University. It all starts off with our recruiting team who spends time out at universities and programs like LaunchCode that train our developers to kind of start off with. RON</p><p class="speaker">RON:</p><p class="spiel"> That's great. Let's see, Stephanie you came from one of those organizations didn’t you? STEPHANIE</p><p class="speaker">STEPHANIE:</p><p class="spiel"> I did. I came from the LaunchCode Coder Girl program.  RON</p><p class="speaker">RON:</p><p class="spiel"> Excellent. And Cale you had some involvement with LaunchCode as well? CALE</p><p class="speaker">CALE:</p><p class="spiel"> Yeah I had some involvement with LaunchCode as well. RON</p><p class="speaker">RON:</p><p class="spiel"> Your backgrounds is a little different though isn't it? You came from a bit of a different career into software development. CALE</p><p class="speaker">CALE:</p><p class="spiel"> Yes, that's correct. I was in the audiovisual industry for about 10 years, and trying to make a career jump I discovered Daugherty University through the recruiting team here. RON</p><p class="speaker">RON:</p><p class="spiel"> I love both of those examples because this is just what we’re looking for. We’re looking for talent. I talk to our recruiters all the time about how talent is more important than experience, because we can take a good athlete and teach them how to do more things, but just to hire someone who happens to know a particular thing and doesn't have as much in terms of the aptitude or interest or drive - it's just not as good of a long-term situation for a company like ours. So this works very nicely. Some great information on Daugherty University. From a Daugherty business perspective this is such a great way for us to to increase even more our value proposition to our customers. We bring in good, talented people in a marketplace where demand is often greater than supply, and we actually create more capability in the marketplace. Also a bright Daugherty University team member here is someone that we can pair with a more experienced Daugherty leader in a way that's good for everyone. It gives us a very strong value proposition in terms of the blended cost to the customer, and it gives our leaders a chance to work in a Daugherty team in a leadership role with bright team members, and it gives our Daugherty University graduates an opportunity to work in a more controlled Daugherty managed environment as they continue to accelerate through their careers. Great stuff all around. So, since this is working so well I think we should do more of it. Matt, do we have any more of our Daugherty University sessions set up? MATT</p><p class="speaker">MATT:</p><p class="spiel"> Yeah absolutely. So our next session for the SA&amp;E line of service here in St. Louis is going to kick off on January 26. RON</p><p class="speaker">RON:</p><p class="spiel"> Okay that's great. So we’re doing Daugherty University sessions mostly here in St. Louis. We’re starting to do some in other cities as well, aren’t we? MATT</p><p class="speaker">MATT:</p><p class="spiel"> Yeah absolutely. So we have a session in Minneapolis and another in Atlanta I believe. RON</p><p class="speaker">RON:</p><p class="spiel"> Okay that's great. I want to continue to tune this so that it’s where it makes the most sense. We can bring folks into Daugherty University, folks into St. Louis, and where it might work better to have the session in another city we do it that way. So we can be flexible with it. Listen, great job all three of you. Thanks for joining me today. ALL</p><p class="speaker">ALL:</p><p class="spiel"> Thank you for having us on. RON</p><p class="speaker">RON:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel"> You're very welcome. Thanks for listening everybody. We’ll talk to you soon.</p>
