<p class="speaker">RON INTRO:</p><p class="spiel"> Hello everybody. We have an exciting podcast today. We will be sharing a number of company highlights from around the Enterprise. We have ugly Christmas sweaters and we have a special Christmas surprise at the end of the podcast that you won't want to miss. All this and more on today's episode of Good Day Daugherty.</p><p class="speaker"><br />RON:</p><p class="spiel"> Hello everybody we’re going to cover a number of the great company highlights from around the Enterprise today. I've asked two of our leaders to join us, Coleen and John, and they’ve been good-natured enough to put on ugly Christmas sweaters for this podcast. Just for you. So I think most of you know Coleen and John, but I'll ask them to introduce themselves and then share some of the highlights from their territories. Go ahead Coleen. COLEEN</p><p class="speaker">COLEEN:</p><p class="spiel">  Hey I’m Coleen Finnegan. I live in Dallas and I am managing the Dallas and Chicago business units. I have been in the Chicago business unit for my first four years at Daugherty and now have the privilege of continuing to work with that team as I am working with the Dallas office to help continue to grow that business unit as well.  JOHN</p><p class="speaker">JOHN:</p><p class="spiel"> Great and I'm John Wirth. I’m a Senior Vice President. I’ve been here for 18 years and I got the privilege and opportunity to support all of our marketplaces to ensure that we’re bringing our capabilities to our clients in a proactive manner, and using that to create the best work for each of you. I happen to live in St. Louis and I am playing a more active and hands-on role with the marketplace at this point. RON</p><p class="speaker">RON:</p><p class="spiel"> Okay wonderful. Thanks. Coleen why don’t you start us off. I know we’re having a lot of success in Dallas and Chicago. If you don't mind, share some of that with us. COLEEN</p><p class="speaker">COLEEN:</p><p class="spiel"> Yeah absolutely. Thanks for letting me come. I actually wore my sweater here, so thanks for accommodating me in getting ones to match. So you know we had a lot of growth in both Dallas and Chicago this year. It has been fantastic. So both business units actually have some similarities which makes it easier for me to give an update on numbers. So there's an increase of about 40% billable consultants in both markets which is fantastic. In Dallas, specifically Southwest Airlines, has grown by about 50% in size since January. We’re also really strategically positioned there. I know you’ve heard on other podcasts that we did some of the update on the estimating and Agile work that we help frame up strategically at Southwest Airlines. We continue to bring thought leadership and position ourselves at a higher level with the groups there. I mean we are looking to help them with the SAFE transformation there and things like that. Outside of Southwest Airlines in Dallas, we’ve opened two really key accounts for us as well. AT&amp;T, which we’re working to see what the next steps are going to be there, and GlaxoSmithKline, which opportunistically just from a capability perspective is really in the space that we want to grow. A lot of you are employees in Dallas and have an interest in both the information management and the big data space. We’re working with them to help them plan for 2018. We have a couple of our consultants really strategically positioned and helping frame up what their programs are going to look like. We are going to be their go-to partner to help them as they build out some of their capabilities in that space from a research and development perspective. So we are really excited about that in Dallas. And also I want to give a little bit of a shout out to our LOS leaders who really helped pull the consultants together and get regular meetings. It’s a way for our consultants to have a regular cadence and network with each other outside of the project work. They're doing a great job with lunch and learns, and we have really made a lot of progress on that front as well. RON</p><p class="speaker">RON:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel"> Excellent. So there in Dallas you're at 45 or so folks in Dallas. What are you thinking for next year Coleen?<br /> <br />COLEEN:</p><p class="spiel"> We will at least double. RON</p><p class="speaker">RON:</p><p class="spiel"> At least double…I like that. Very exciting. COLEEN</p><p class="speaker">COLEEN:</p><p class="spiel"> Absolutely. We have lots of opportunity. We just have to gift wrap it. RON</p><p class="speaker">RON:</p><p class="spiel"> Very nice. Good.  COLEEN</p><p class="speaker">COLEEN:</p><p class="spiel"> Some details for Chicago…I mentioned there's a 40% increase in growth from a billable consultant perspective. McDonald’s specifically grew about 60% this year, so I told Deb that the Northwest accounts are starting to come after them because they are starting to outgrow the Northwest. It is a good healthy competition. RON</p><p class="speaker">RON:</p><p class="spiel"> So Deb Yeazel, our Engagement Manager for McDonald’s has been doing a great job. COLEEN</p><p class="speaker">COLEEN:</p><p class="spiel"> She absolutely has. And that team has been doing a great job pulling together and really helping identify what the opportunities are. They’re doing a good job working as a team to see where things were and to connect the dots in some ways that we can help and work in the different areas where we haven’t been in the past which is fantastic. We also opened two really strategic accounts in Chicago - United Airlines and Ulta. So Ulta was growing hand over fist from a retail perspective which is different than a lot of other retailers and they’re innovative and need some help in both DevOps areas and how they’re setting up their PMOs. So the team is doing a great job of digging into that and how we can help.  RON</p><p class="speaker">RON:</p><p class="spiel"> Their CEO is Mary Dillon.</p><p class="speaker"><br />COLEEN:</p><p class="spiel"> Yup. And she is one of the CEOs that has been named the biggest up and comers in the industry I believe.</p><p class="speaker"><br />RON:</p><p class="spiel"> She has. And she came McDonald's didn’t she? COLEEN</p><p class="speaker">COLEEN:</p><p class="spiel"> Maybe. I don’t know.</p><p class="speaker"><br />RON:</p><p class="spiel"> I think so. I think she was one of the the marketing leaders in that organization and then she moved over to the CEO role. That's what I believe. I think that is the situation anyway, so good for those folks. Very good.  COLEEN</p><p class="speaker">COLEEN:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel"> Yeah.<br /> <br />RON:</p><p class="spiel"> So, great. Positive trajectory in both of those cities. Really good work by the teams in Chicago and in Dallas. Really appreciate that. So John how about… JOHN</p><p class="speaker">JOHN:</p><p class="spiel"> That's great. So I love that news and let’s build upon it a little bit with a few of the other markets, Ron. I will start in St. Louis. In St. Louis we hit a big milestone this year. We passed 500 employees in the marketplace. We were recognized as the Best Place to Work and also recognized as the largest professional consultancy in the market. So big milestones. Some of the things that fueled that was growth in our anchor accounts. So, at Monsanto we passed the hundred employee mark; another nice milestone. A year and a half ago we weren’t doing a lot of development work for them. We now have seven development pods working for Monsanto, in the Development Center as well as some of the work happening at the client site. We are just really proud of the team and how that's come along. Charter Communications- RON</p><p class="speaker">RON:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel"> How many folks do you have working out of our St. Louis Development Center?<br /> <br />JOHN:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel"> A little north of a hundred. While we’re on that topic - we doubled the Development Center space in St. Louis this year and we expect to pack that in quickly.<br /> <br />RON:</p><p class="spiel"> We are taking over the 11th floor, which is the top floor in this building. I saw a sign up on one of the doors that said, “Here at Daugherty we can go to the 11th floor.” So, everybody else can just go to the tenth.” I like the spirit behind that. JOHN</p><p class="speaker">JOHN:</p><p class="spiel"> I do too, Ron. We like that. So, there's a lot of great news. Just a few other highlights - Charter Communications purchased Time Warner Cable and they’re just continuing to invest and grow. We had a milestone year in approving the company to company partnership with Charter this year. Just really, really good and now we’re operating at the CIO and Vice President level on their strategic initiatives as they change the cable industry and how they interact with the consumer…not thinking of an address but thinking as a consumer in the services that they get. Another highlight would be Express Scripts. At Express Scripts we took over the Agile transformation work for Deloitte where Deloitte was not getting the job done. They brought an academic and theoretical perspective and we stepped in and brought a practical perspective and are helping move that forward. Several markets are contributing to that St. Louis, Minneapolis and our New Jersey team as well.</p><p class="speaker"><br />RON:</p><p class="spiel">  So we did a better job than Deloitte. Can you say that on the air? I think so! That's great.</p><p class="speaker"><br />JOHN:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel"> We are also engaged in helping them as they look at new ways to transform their business, generate revenue and take care of the 80 million members they have. So an Enterprise team…the St. Louis team recently wrapped up an Enterprise data and analytics strategy engagement, Ron, that we’re all real proud of and should open some doors for follow-through and pull through work, but it it moved our partnership with them to the next level.<br /> <br />RON:</p><p class="spiel"> That’s great.  JOHN</p><p class="speaker">JOHN:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel"> So a lot of good things to talk about at Express Scripts. At Centene we grew by more than 300% this year. It's an account where with that fast growth we are also using all of our services. All the focus there is Agile transformation, Development Center work, PMO optimization, the data and analytics work that we’re doing. So Centene is a highlight as well. Anheuser-Busch, one of our first customers, so the mobility team’s always done a great job helping to ensure that we get product to the store shelves and capture information for planning purposes. We just renegotiated another four-year agreement to provide services to Anheuser-Busch. So that's just another great milestone. Couple of other quick things:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel"> new clients – Lumeris, a healthcare products company that we've opened up this year. American Commercial Barge Lines, the largest inland waterways transportation company that we’re doing work for and a multiyear agreement with them. FinLocker is a start-up that's gone a little past start-up, but we believe could be a mortgage industry game changer, building software products for the personal financial lockers for each of us. We’re building their next software product.<br /> <br />RON:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel"> Fantastic. That's great. So many good things going on. What about some of the other cities that you're working in John?<br /> <br />JOHN:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel"> Just one more thing I do want to mention. It's important. The Daugherty University concept is important to all of our marketplaces and we will be doing more more of that. In St. Louis we have two graduating classes this year and those employees are just really having a nice impact. Next year we intend to have 3 to 4 Daugherty University programs.<br /> <br />RON:</p><p class="spiel"> I love it.  JOHN</p><p class="speaker">JOHN:</p><p class="spiel"> In Atlanta, moving a little bit south, we've added three Client Partners to the team and we've already seen the really positive impact on our employees and our clients. At Cox communications, where Dan is playing a very hands-on role… RON</p><p class="speaker">RON:</p><p class="spiel"> Dan O’Keefe, our Client Partner there. JOHN</p><p class="speaker">JOHN:</p><p class="spiel"> And Managing Director there.</p><p class="speaker"><br />RON:</p><p class="spiel"> We promoted him. Congratulations Dan!  JOHN</p><p class="speaker">JOHN:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel"> So Dan’s helping, and there is support from the Enterprise from David Hoyt and his team, but we’re now working at the Senior Vice President level for Cox Communications. The team’s also been successful at positioning other services there that we hadn't provided recently - data and analytics type work, software development work – so just really positive momentum building at Cox Communications. At the Home Depot, the team there is is now engaged with the Store of the Future work for the Home Depot. Just game changing. They're not going to let Amazon take over their business, and we appreciate that attitude as well. So in the Store of the Future, we’re now taking accountability for software development work. We are moving into the product ownership space like no one else has done. So just a lot of momentum building there. We’re at the front stage of what could be a major expansion for the Home Depot in Atlanta as well as into another Texas market. At GPC Napa we help them with their digital program around Napa Express, where they had some fits and starts. We help them get on a good trajectory and a good pace there. So the team’s doing well. We just continue to do really good work with companies like Hyatt, Serta, Delta Credit, the Paradies shops and so on. I believe the team has grown by 10-15% in just the last couple months, so the trajectories steepening. It looks good. If we move north into Minneapolis, one of the high growth business units as well - 40% give or take growth for this year. We've expanded into a couple of new customers that we now are a bit more distributed. We have more than 25 folks at Express Scripts, 25 or so at Best Buy doing some strategic work for them, and Cargill, which was a big story for 2016, we continue to build on that. We’re north of 50 employees there, but it moved beyond the PMO and we’re now in the Immersive Learning Centers there building prototypes for them so they can evaluate it and turn it into a long-term product development effort.<br /> <br />RON:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel"> That's great. It's a great fit for us. Sort of a situation where something needs to.be done quickly, a proof of concept, so it can be determined if it should be moved into mainstream production and we can really step into that niche nicely.<br /> <br />JOHN:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel"> Yeah that's right. And the Minneapolis team has always been there to support our expansion into New York. So the initial growth was with Franklin Lakes, but Minneapolis deserves credit for helping to ensure that we’re taking care of our folks and we’re expanding in the market. We’ll be taking more of a formal approach into that next year, but we’re north of 20 employees in Franklin Lakes right now.<br /> <br />RON:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel"> We love you guys in Franklin Lakes and Santa Claus is coming to town. We’re looking for office space right now. We are going to invest in infrastructure. You are doing such a great job and we’re going to bring more support your way. Thanks so much.<br /> <br />COLEEN:</p><p class="spiel"> Can I actually give a little shout out to Minneapolis as well? They really helped Dallas a lot this year as we were continuing to grow at Southwest Airlines. We did a great job of selling work that we didn’t have the bandwidth to actually support, and Minneapolis really stepped in and helped us and we’ve done a good job working with them to do succession planning and bringing the work locally. So it is a full pot that we have in Dallas now, but Minneapolis really helped us grow and we want to thank you guys for that.</p><p class="speaker"><br />RON:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel"> Great. From an Enterprise perspective there are a couple of things I'd like to add. We've done a tremendous number of positive things supporting our communities and there was a recent podcast that you can view to get more detail there. I won't take time to recap that today, but I really do appreciate everybody's good work and the spirit behind what we’re doing to support our communities, and all the worthy causes that we’re helping out there. If you look at where we are as a business, the trajectory is so positive consistently across the Enterprise and it's really exciting as we think about how we are moving into 2018, and we’re anticipating our best year ever in 2018. We’re very excited about it. Of course that's all built on the hard work that all of you are doing so that's very much appreciated. As we look at the growth of the business and our positive movement forward it's so important that we translate that to opportunities for all of you. So personal and career development is a major area of focus for us moving forward and before the end of January you'll see some of the training and the support materials that we have been working on over the last several weeks. I'm excited about it because this is one of the ways that we translate our success as a company to opportunity for all of you. A tremendously important thing to me and to all of us. So we’re working on better training, better support, better tools to provide to our leaders so they can provide better support for the rest of us. In addition, I want to make some this training and development available to every employee in the company so that if you have an interest or think you might have an interest in taking on more of a Daugherty leadership role, you can get involved and hear more about what that's about. You can then position yourself. In addition to that we want to make it crystal clear that every employee has career opportunity here whether you want to be a formal Daugherty leader - a Team Manager or Engagement Manager - or not. So helping everyone advance in the manner that is most interesting to you is top of mind for us. So we want to provide the support. We’re looking for ways to provide you more time to do that. Time is so hard for us to come by these days for everybody, it’s so precious. So how do we free up time to provide you, to provide all of us, to work on personal professional career development, learning and so on? So a number of those things are in the works. You'll see the outcome of that over the next few weeks. Really looking forward to it. Let me just wrap up by saying I really appreciate everybody's good work. So proud of the team. Looking forward to moving forward in 2018. Happy holidays everybody. Talk to you soon.</p>
