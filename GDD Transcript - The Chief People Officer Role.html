<p class="speaker"><strong>Intro:</p><p class="spiel"></strong>In today's podcast, it’s just me – talking about the future of Daugherty.  I appreciate you listening.  In addition, some important anniversary dates, some impressive company highlights, as well as the continuation of an interesting contest that we kicked off last week, which I'll describe more fully in our next episode. Thanks for watching everybody!<strong>Anniversaries</p><p class="speaker"><strong>Anniversaries:</p><p class="spiel"></strong>Two important anniversaries in the month of August are Zach Hayes, five years in St. Louis, and Ben Cho, also five years in Atlanta.  Congratulations Zach and Ben, really appreciate your service and all your good work. <strong>Highlights</p><p class="speaker"><strong>Highlights:</p><p class="spiel"></strong>In Dallas, our Daugherty teammates helped the Operations and Investigations team at Southwest Airlines implement their Centralized Irregularity Reporting Investigation System - or CIRIS.  Despite CIRIS being a packaged software solution, Southwest chose Daugherty to help them with implementation over the software vendor because of the professionalism and leadership we demonstrated in similar engagements.  Based on the positive momentum generated from this effort, we now have the opportunity to expand our role even more in this area. Congratulations to Jason Meyers, Mark Hasty, Cristy Kubacak, and the rest of the Dallas Team!Last month, Adam Kaplan started a project with Allstate’s Underwriting Transformation Program. Since the beginning of his engagement, Adam has become a trusted advisor to Allstate’s team of Directors.  He has identified multiple opportunities for Daugherty to bring additional value, including an opportunity for us to help an Allstate team in Dallas!  In fact, we just learned that we’ve won the engagement in Dallas and will begin work shortly!  This is a great example of CSA2 in action</p><p class="speaker">Last month, Adam Kaplan started a project with Allstate’s Underwriting Transformation Program.

Great job Adam, keep up the great work!Just recently in Minneapolis, Daugherty teammate Luke Mayer was invited speak at the Express Scripts Emerging Leaders’ Summit. This daylong summit brought together 50 Senior Managers and Leaders to spend a day exploring how to shape Express Scripts’ culture for the future. Luke, using a ‘chalk talk’ format, led an engaging discussion on why risk-taking is necessary and critical to ESI’s mission. The talk was so well received, that it was extended by 90 minutes at the request of participants and senior leaders in order to accommodate additional dialogue! Several people commented that the risk-taking discussion was one of the most impactful and meaningful exchanges the group had had in a long time. Congratulations Luke, well done!</p><p class="spiel">The New York/New Jersey business unit has officially opened a new office space to accommodate growing business demands and our growing team in the Big Apple.  The New York/New Jersey area team is now over 20 members and is looking to double that number over the next year.  A lot of great things to come from New York/New Jersey.</p><p class="spiel">In St. Louis, Daugherty’s own Alex Gillette was named as a St. Louis Business Journal 30-Under-30 Award Recipient! This award recognizes the best and brightest individuals in the region that have achieved exceptional results in their fields and made a positive impact in their communities and Alex is a great example of this! </p><p class="spiel">There are always so many things to share from around the enterprise, so many highlights, I look forward to this segment every time. We will have more in our next podcast.<strong>The Chief People Officer Role</p><p class="speaker"><strong>The Chief People Officer Role:</p><p class="spiel"></strong></p><p class="speaker">There are so many things here at Daugherty that I'm proud of, things that I'm impressed with.  And there are also other things that I'd like to see us do better. So, this will be the first podcast in a series over the next few weeks, focused on how we’re going to make our company better.  What are some of the investments that we can make to create an even better organization:</p><p class="spiel"> this is very important to me and I appreciate your watching. I'd like to hear some of your input and ideas as we go.</p><p class="speaker">One of the things that is just critically important to me, is that as the company grows and succeeds, and we’re on a really good track – a really good track right now – I want our success as a business to be directly connected to your opportunity as an individual, as a teammate here at Daugherty.  So, we need to do some things that are better with performance management, with how we handle recognition and rewards and we have some really good people working on those things right now.  But there's something that's missing and I want to make a further investment:</p><p class="spiel"> a Chief People Officer.</p><p class="speaker">The search has already started. And in fact, just in a couple of leadership meetings, I've mentioned my interest in adding a Chief People Officer and I've already gotten a couple good referrals.  Jim Johnson in Atlanta has given a couple, in fact, that looked pretty promising.  So, I want to give you an update over the next few podcasts on the Chief People Officer role:</p><p class="spiel"> how is going to help us ensure that there are systems, processes, tools in place that fully support our vision and our culture.  This is critically important to me. I want this company to get better as it gets bigger.  We’re on a growth track and I want that to be a good thing for everybody.  So, more to come on the Chief People Officer.  There will also be updates over the next few podcast regarding other things were doing – things that will help us connect with our employees, improve how we do performance management and connect the dots as the organization continues to move forward in a manner that makes it an even better place for you to work.  And this has to happen. As I said, I am very proud of where we are and very committed to making us even better.  Our success does something that I always knew it would; it gives me the ability to invest more in the business and in you.  So, please listen and give me your input as we talk about the best ways to do that.  I'm really looking forward to this next series, really looking forward to it, thanks so much for watching everybody!</p></p><p class="speaker">As I said, I am very proud of where we are and very committed to making us even better.
