<p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">            This is the second in our two part series on the software architecture and engineer line of service. I'll also be covering some important anniversaries, some interesting company highlights. All this and more on today's episode of Good Day Daugherty.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">            Let's start our anniversaries here in St. Louis with Kevin Johnson. Kevin has been with Daugherty for 20 years. Congratulations Kevin, really appreciate it. Also, at five years, Phyllis Alexander, Zack Dangos, Martin Gruettemeyer, Anthony Savio, Karen Dupske, Caitlyn Marshall, and Jonyette Guest. All five years here in St. Louis. Congratulations. In Atlanta, also at five years, Andrew Soltis and Paul Grant. In Minneapolis, Eric Ollanketo and Ruben Van Hemert each celebrate five years. Really appreciate it everyone. Thanks for all your great work for Daugherty.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">            It's amazing how many interesting company highlights we have around Daugherty, and I'd like to share some with you now. In Minneapolis Daugherty is making a significant positive impact at Compeer Financial through our involvement with Project Germinate. Vinaya Gore, Zach Johnson, Eric Keiper have been working with the client to integrate three legacy organizations by the end of 2018. Within short order Vinaya realized that Compeer's process centric approach would not enable Compeer to achieve their objective in time, and worked with business decision makers including the Compeer board and CEO, the executive leadership team, and the steering committee to adjust the program toward a technology driven approach. With the new plan in place, the program is back on track. Because Daugherty's knowledge and leadership was showcased through this process, the team has grown from three members to a strong team of 19 Daugherty consultants, and Daugherty is recognized as a trusted advisor to Compeer. </p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">            Congratulations to our Atlanta and Chicago business units for recently being chosen as a Best and Brightest Company to Work For. In Atlanta, this marks the sixth consecutive year of recognition. Six years in a row! That's fantastic. Chicago is now on back to back to years. To qualify for this award, businesses are evaluated in several areas including employee education and development, work life balance, community initiatives, strategic company performance and recruiting. Both teams will attend award celebrations, Atlanta on June 28th and Chicago on July 27th. Congratulations again to our teammates in Atlanta and Chicago for earning this honor and for making Daugherty a great place to work.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">            We continue to make great strides in the New York area. We've recently brought on Dean Hoffman, our first full-time local Daugherty recruiter in New York/New Jersey. Dean is focused on helping us identify and attract more high quality Daugherty profiles as we continue to expand the team and our client base. We started building relationship maps of current Daugherty customers that have a large presence in the New York area, such as Charter, MasterCard, and Rabo AgriFinance. Great things are happening in the Big Apple.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">            In Dallas, for the second straight year Daugherty helped support AT&amp;T during their HACEMOS golf tournament. HACEMOS is an internal AT&amp;T employee resource group that raises money and provides scholarships for Latinos with a focus on STEM, science, technology, engineering and math. Terry Longhway and Tricia Mearkley represented team Daugherty at the event, and along the way had a series of conversations with other golfers prior to teeing off. We're following up with many of the people that we met and have already had two meaningful business meetings with several future meetings planned in key areas like application development, big data, and customer experience. A big thank you to the Dallas team for supporting our client through such a worthwhile cause. </p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">            Last month St. Louis held their first business unit meeting of 2018. With a room full of team Daugherty consultants, John Wirth gave a great update on the state of the branch. Over $80 million in revenue in 2017. Projected revenue of $88 million for 2018. Our business unit is strong in St. Louis. We've surpassed over 500 employees, and we'll grow revenue to $100 million by 2020. We've added clients, new clients like Enterprise Holdings, Wells Fargo, Maris, and more. Throughout the evening line of service leadership shared updates, success stories, and helped recognize some of the great work being done by our consultants. Thanks to all who were able to attend. It was great to see you there.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">            And thanks everybody for your wonderful work around the company. It's just so rewarding to see so many worthy updates and highlights to share every week.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">            Now here's part two of our discussion with the software architecture and engineering line of service team. </p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">            That's a lot of great work that we've talked about, wonderful success stories from around the Daugherty enterprise, but how about New York/New Jersey John? Give us an update from that business unit.</p><p class="speaker">John Wirth:</p><p class="spiel">                  Well what comes to mind is what really started as a teaming effort. There's a leader that we've really supported around the claims researching tool in the PBM space. We helped migrate and modernize an application in that area, moving it from DB6 to the modern technologies. That's helped to get our promotion and put her in the limelight of taking on greater responsibility to modernize all their PBM platforms. We're working to put a plan together to support her that is going to really raise the visibility and the need to build out our teams in the Franklin Lakes, New York area, as well as the St. Louis footprint of Express Scripts. It was a teaming effort because it was our Minneapolis and St. Louis teams working closely together to demonstrate our capability. Now the teams are working closely with Scott Stein in New York to build out a plan to help support the transformation.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">            That's great. That's a great success story. The New York/New Jersey office is very important to us for a couple reasons. One is that it's allowing us to provide a greater level of enterprise support, and even collaboration and coordination across the major Express Scripts locations, the Twin Cities, St. Louis, and Franklin Lakes. But also ... And with Scott Stein, our client partner who's helping us do that by operating as client partner for Express Scripts across the entire enterprise. But also it's the starting point for building out that regional office in New York/New Jersey. There's a huge amount of opportunity there. Things are starting to move forward, and we'll update more on that later. That's another great story.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">            One of the things that's been mentioned a couple of times is the development center. It's interesting how important the development center has become to us, and how much opportunity we see associated with it. Dave, if you don't mind, give us an update on the development center.</p><p class="speaker">Dave Hoyt:</p><p class="spiel">                   Sure. The development center is a really important aspect of what we're doing in software engineering, and in fact represents a big growth opportunity for us. Almost all our clients right now are really reevaluating the way they're doing software and application development across the board. They're really looking hard at, as they begin to adopt Agile, the importance of co-locating teams. They're looking hard at hidden costs within the offshore model. They're really rethinking their entire sourcing approach for application and software development. As they do that, we've really been, I think, very proactive in offering some great alternatives. </p><p class="speaker">Dave Hoyt:</p><p class="spiel">                   Increasingly, as we build out our capabilities in the development center, we're focused on this concept called the unified development center approach. At the heart of that is really positioning us to be an advisor to the client and picking the right recipe, the right mix of software engineering approaches, whether that be on site development pods that Daugherty is running, or whether it be development pods in our development centers, maybe multiple development pods spanning multiple development centers, or even hybrid mix co-staff scenarios where we're bringing client employees into our development centers and working as part of our development pods. What we're finding is that that's really driving great results. The client really appreciate the ability to incubate their employees in the latest Agile development techniques and approaches. </p><p class="speaker">Dave Hoyt:</p><p class="spiel">                   We're also finding that it's a very fast way to develop software, gives us a lot of responsiveness back to the business, and it's cost effective, which is kind of a big point out there. Everyone thinks about offshore as being the low cost way to develop software, but we've had the fortunate ability to do some benchmarking. In fact, just recently wrapped up benchmarking across six projects, six development pods. What we found was our onshore development pods were running anywhere from 19% to 65% more cost effective than the offshore development pods. So while being a low cost option isn't our go to market strategy, the ability to say we're just as cost effective as offshore is a very important point as we move forward.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">            Dave, let me make sure I understand. The Daugherty value proposition is superior to that of any of our competitors, plus we're just more fun and interesting to work with.</p><p class="speaker">Dave Hoyt:</p><p class="spiel">                   That's right. Faster, higher quality, and just as cost effective.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">            I love it. I love it. That's great. Good.</p><p class="speaker">Dave Hoyt:</p><p class="spiel">                   That's right. So, there's a lot of excitement there around the capabilities we're continuing to grow in that development center. We have about 20 pods developing software in those development centers right now, and it's a proven approach. We've completed 80 project initiatives now within our development centers successfully. So really, really very exciting. There's a lot of ways to get started with that. We see clients where maybe they have work that needs to get done urgently, and we can roll right into a development pod in our development center. Scenarios where maybe the client's interested in testing it as an approach, and we maybe pick a pilot project to do within our development center. Or maybe they just have a rapid prototype that they need to get completed. That's often times a great way to get started.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">            Well that's great. It's a wonderful differentiator for us isn't it? There's a concept associated with it that requires an investment to build out development centers. I believe John we've just taken over the entire 11th floor here in St. Louis haven't we?</p><p class="speaker">John Wirth:</p><p class="spiel">                  We did. We've added roughly 25,000 additional square feet to development center space.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">            Wonderful. Wonderful. So, the investing in, creating, having great capabilities, but combining that with flexibility, and a truly partnering advisory approach to help our customers understand how to put together the right solution for their business situation. That's one of the roles that the development center plays for us. </p><p class="speaker">John Wirth:</p><p class="spiel">                  That's right.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">            Good. Wonderful.</p><p class="speaker">John Wirth:</p><p class="spiel">                  Great. </p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel">            Well very good. You know Agile has come up a couple of times. It's really interesting because Agile has been part of the discussion for every line of service, every line of service podcast that I've done. That's one of the reasons that we've decided to not make Agile its own line of service because it's associated with, plays an important role, in every line of service, but it deserves some more time. So we're going to dedicate an entire podcast to Agile, and we're going to make it our next podcast. You can just think of it as an extension of this one in many ways, but really it's connected to every line of service. We're going to talk about that next time. Thanks for listening. We'll talk to you soon. </p>
