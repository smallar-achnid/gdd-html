<p class="speaker">RON:</p><p class="spiel"> We have a very interesting application to share with you today – one that shows off our user interface and design capabilities, as well as our industrial-strength technology development skills. Plus, I’ll share a number of company highlights. There are really interesting things going on around the Daugherty enterprise… all this and more, on today's episode of Good Day Daugherty. </p><p class="spiel"> RON</p><p class="speaker">RON:</p><p class="spiel"> Let me share with you, some highlights from around the company. I'll start with Minneapolis. In the Twin Cities Charlie Kuharski and Pat Graven, along with Cargill's data science team, are working together to build a grain delivery and transportation optimization application for Cargill’s trade office in South Africa. This application, named OptiTrade, will optimize grain storage and transportation costs based on various factors including sustainability - that is completing grain deliveries with the least impact to the environment - and based on it’s warm reception and initial success in South Africa, it looks like OptiTrade will be rolled out to a number of additional countries. Great job team! In Atlanta, the Daugherty team at Home Depot landed an early-stage on-site development team to begin working on a prototype for a virtual kitchen design application. The initial team of four consultants will begin thinking of solutions to help move Home Depot's customers through the entire lifecycle of the kitchen renovation - from preliminary design ideas all the way through purchase and installation. As the product progresses and the vision of the product becomes clearer the Daugherty team will expand. Very interesting. Good job there in Atlanta. Alright…a couple of things that are going on in Dallas. We were invited to respond to an RFP at Southwest Airlines to lead an enterprise-wide Agile transformation. This would be a huge win. We have all hands-on deck to pull that together. Very exciting. Also, in Dallas at GlaskoSmithKline, Naveen Pinjani and Coleen Finnegan were invited to participate in a 2018 planning session for the company. So, Naveen and Coleen get an inside look at GSK's areas of focus for 2018 and are working with our leader on the ground, Bryant Robinson, and our business development leader, Tricia Mearkley, to pull together Daugherty's point of view based on what they heard. So, some very cool leading edge technologies are at play so we’re excited and think we’re in good position to win this one. Good job there in Dallas. In St. Louis we just kicked off our newest Daugherty University class – an SA&amp;E Daugherty University in this case. Eight smart, likable, motivated technologists were chosen to join the seven-week Daugherty University program and will graduate and become Daugherty teammates ready to join any of our engagements. This group had to go through a quite rigorous selection process and were the winners who were chosen to participate in Daugherty University, and I believe we have a class picture here for you. Okay very good. This is the fourth Daugherty University SA&amp;E session since 2016, with plans for two or three more this year. Really picking up the momentum and I really love Daugherty University across all of our lines of service. Very nice when we're helping to create and develop more capability in our marketplace it's another value add and another differentiator. So big thank you to our recruiting team as well as the SA&amp;E leadership finding and qualifying the right talent, and also the consultants who will participate in the mentorship and growth of these individuals during the program. Great job everybody. Since the beginning of the year the Chicago branch has seen growth on a number of levels, adding several new team members to the business unit, growing two of our anchor accounts - McDonald's and Walgreens - and also with respect to a new account Ulta Beauty, a very interesting one, we have secured a meeting with their CIO and look forward to sharing Daugherty's capabilities and expanding our footprint significantly at Ulta. So great job Dennis St. Clair and the Ulta team for making that happen. Good job. Two more things I'd like to mention. Just a shout out to the Franklin Lakes team - you folks are doing a great job and we’re continuing to grow there and we’re going to be standing up Franklin Lakes as more of its own full-blown regional office this year. Very excited about doing that and we’ll have more to come and more highlights from Franklin Lakes in our podcasts in the future. In addition to that there are just a number of very interesting community outreach causes that we’re supporting - even just in the first quarter of this year. Just last Saturday a number of us were at this year's Dancing with the St. Louis Stars to support the Independent Center which, as you may know, helps those suffering from depression and mental illness. Another great cause. So, a fun evening. Hundreds of thousands of dollars were raised for the cause. Just the sort of thing we like to support in our communities. Next time I'll give you an update on more of those kinds of things that are going on. INTRO MUSIC<br /> <br />RON</p><p class="speaker">INTRO MUSIC<br /> <br />RON:</p><p class="spiel"> We have a very interesting application to show you today. I'm excited to share it with you. But first, let's start with some introductions. Why don’t you get us started Stephanie? STEPHANIE</p><p class="speaker">STEPHANIE:</p><p class="spiel"> Sure. I’m Stephanie Lawrence. BILL</p><p class="speaker">BILL:</p><p class="spiel"> I'm Bill Richards. GEORGE</p><p class="speaker">GEORGE:</p><p class="spiel"> George Lejnine. RON</p><p class="speaker">RON:</p><p class="spiel"> Okay great. Tell us a little bit more. Stephanie I believe you are a Daugherty University graduate.</p><p class="speaker"><br />STEPHANIE:</p><p class="spiel"> That’s correct. I graduated in September of last year and I now I’m working as a Scrum Master for this application.</p><p class="speaker"><br />RON:</p><p class="spiel"> That's fantastic. Daugherty University in September and already a Scrum Master. Good for you. Bill, you've been with the company for a while. BILL</p><p class="speaker">BILL:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel"> Yes. I've been with Daugherty for 17 years. I’ve really been completely immersed in the mobile solutions that we’ve built for Anheuser-Busch and their wholesaler network. Over 450 wholesalers strong.<br /> <br />RON:</p><p class="spiel"> That's great. George how about you…how long have you been with Daugherty? GEORGE</p><p class="speaker">GEORGE:</p><p class="spiel"> I’m a new hire who came on here in November and the second day I was here I was put on this project.  RON</p><p class="speaker">RON:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel"> Great…well what’d you do on the first day? Just kidding! That's great. That's fantastic. I'm glad we were able to get you involved in something so interesting right away. Good and we appreciate your help with it. Okay, so let's talk about this application. Bill, if you don't mind, share a bit of the business context.<br /> <br />BILL:</p><p class="spiel"> Yes. AB has a network of 450 wholesalers that sell beer for them at the retail trade and over 20,000 sales reps and delivery drivers. What the context for the app had to do with is the sales group has a high-end group that, as AB has been acquiring craft brands and craft breweries, they want to promote those beers more broadly out to retail accounts. The first step in that was to accommodate the high-end group being able to promote and really push the right kinds of beers in this portfolio to every wholesaler that attended the sales and marketing meetings that took place this past week in New Orleans.  RON</p><p class="speaker">RON:</p><p class="spiel"> Their big sales and marketing conference that they have once a year.</p><p class="speaker"><br />BILL:</p><p class="spiel"> Yes, once a year. RON</p><p class="speaker">RON:</p><p class="spiel"> This is the high-end product line, much of that associated with craft beer products that they've acquired more recently in most cases.</p><p class="speaker"><br />BILL:</p><p class="spiel"> That's right and the portfolio itself tends to be much more low-volume but high-margin and they want to make sure they're putting these beers into the right accounts and with the right mix of product. </p><p class="speaker"><br />RON:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel"> And the products are probably less well known to the wholesalers in general, so they just want to make sure that their supply chain is positioning these products appropriately.<br /> <br />BILL:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel"> That's right and as educated as possible. Selling benefits to the right customer base and to the right retail account to serve those customers.<br /> <br />RON:</p><p class="spiel"> Very good. So, this application was developed for the SAMCOM conference. What does that stand for again? BILL</p><p class="speaker">BILL:</p><p class="spiel"> Sales and marketing communication meeting. RON</p><p class="speaker">RON:</p><p class="spiel"> Right. So, a pretty big deal for Anheuser-Busch and they’ll have thousands of wholesalers and distributors there.</p><p class="speaker"><br />BILL:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel"> Yes, and employees of these distributors who need to learn more about the portfolio itself and what they're going to do with it. What beers should be selling in their marketplace, what are they selling and what are they not selling yet that they need to learn more about. <br /><br />RON:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel"> So, this application ran there. This was just last week wasn’t it?<br /> <br />BILL:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel"> Yes, just last week. It had a very good turnout and quite a good feedback about how successful it was for them and the follow-up to that is expanding this application to something much more broad. It would go out to all their sales rep to potentially handle more than just the high-end. So, craft beers plus other core brands.<br /> <br />RON:</p><p class="spiel"> Interesting. So, let's come back to that later. I know everyone's anxious to see what this looks like and it shows off very nicely. Stephanie could you kind of take us through a bit of a demo?<br /> <br /></p><p class="speaker">STEPHANIE:</p><p class="spiel"> Sure! So, George is going to be our sort of hand model today. So, what you’re doing now is just logging in. We needed to implement this security feature because the beers are specific to the wholesalers and their id’s. They can only view the beers that are available in their region. So, this is the opening page and this would be the beers at the bottom. The beers would be able to be filtered of course by what wholesales has entered their ID and if we just pick one – let’s say Golden Road. So, the first page you are going to see is a vision photo which really encompasses what their vision is for the company. For instance, Golden Road is a California company and they want to have the California vibe, so the beaches, the surfers, the parties on the beaches, that kind of vibe. Then next is a video. VIDEO PLAYS</p><p class="speaker">VIDEO PLAYS:</p><p class="spiel"> At Golden Road we’re obsessed with beer. Using only the freshest ingredients we brew, ferment and taste over and over until we get it right. We can our beer to keep it fresh so you can take us anywhere the sun hits. We don’t just make beer for people who like beer, we make beer for people who love it. Golden Road – made in LA. STEPHANIE</p><p class="speaker">STEPHANIE:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel"> So, then each beer line has its own specific video obviously.<br /> <br />RON:</p><p class="spiel"> Very nice and very powerful. So, it immerses the viewer in the Golden Road experience. So they can internalize what this product is about, how to position it and how to sell it.</p><p class="speaker"><br />STEPHANIE:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel">  Exactly. So the next one is going to be the sell sheets and this is actually what the application was created for. The main purpose was a digitalized sell sheet so when you go to this conference and you try these beers and maybe you decide you want to buy that beer line or a specific brand, you don't have to walk around with a sheet of paper that, you know, has information about it. Now you're just emailing to yourself the sell sheets so that you can view them whenever you get home and show them to the people that need to see them. It has all the information in a very small and easy-to-use email.<br /> <br />RON:</p><p class="spiel"> So these are beer sales people that are traveling around on their route, stopping at retail stores, grocery stores, liquor stores, restaurants and so they are representing a number of different products and so to be able to have a digital sell sheet in a powerful sales support tool is part of what's going on here. STEPHANIE</p><p class="speaker">STEPHANIE:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel"> Exactly. So then we have just a few more tabs. We have a calendar and the calendar is specific to the state that the wholesaler is in. For example, this one is Missouri. So it’s a game plan calendar that has what beers sell the best during what times. It’s a trimester calendar. For instance, Shocktop beers sell the best in the summer.<br /> <br />RON:</p><p class="spiel"> Interesting. So some analytics and historical perspective here to help predict how to best position the product for the future. STEPHANIE</p><p class="speaker">STEPHANIE:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel"> Exactly. So, the next thing is the trade assets. So the trade assets are things that you can, as a salesperson, maybe give out at bars. I’m sure you’ve seen them at bars – the coasters, umbrellas,        t-shirts – all of the things that come with that specific beer line, those are the things that are available to you. So there are buckets and all sorts of different, cool gadgets.<br /> <br />RON:</p><p class="spiel"> Some things specific to Golden Road in this case.</p><p class="speaker"><br />STEPHANIE:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel"> Correct. So the last thing is SAP, which stands for Space Assortment and Price. I think Bill could actually tell you a little bit better explanation of that.<br /> <br />BILL:</p><p class="spiel"> Space Assortment Price really is a focus for where do you put the brand, point-of-sale materials and displays in positions within the store at the point of what variety of beer product you’re going to have within that portfolio and the price points of those beers.</p><p class="speaker"><br />RON:</p><p class="spiel"> Great stuff. Let me just jump in and mention one of the things that I really like about this application. It requires strong design and user interface. That component is really important, but at the same time there's a lot going on behind the scenes. So it's just a perfect example of the Daugherty differentiation. In fact we competed with design and marketing firms for this work didn’t we? We had to fight our way in and because the historical perspective from AB and many companies is that if you want something like this with video and strong user interface design, you have to go to a design firm. But, the design firms are not as strong as we are on the technology front. So now that we've upped our game over the last few years so that we can do that work that's even better than theirs on the design side, we have the whole package. Why look further than the whole package? We’ve leveraged the marcom group - they’re off the camera here, but they're always with us -  and the marcom team came in and helped with some of that design work along with the rest of the team.</p><p class="speaker"><br />BILL:</p><p class="spiel"> You know we compete with firms out of downtown Manhattan in New York City…the nature of it is, you know, a lot of design on their side but with nothing in the context of what you just mentioned, Ron. The third tier of that is our business knowledge of AB and the processes that they follow in terms of selling beer and how wholesalers sell beer in that three-tier network. RON</p><p class="speaker">RON:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel"> That’s a great point. So, we put this together just in the last week or so. It was rolled out at SAMCOM and it was really well received. We made our point that we can do this sort of thing just as well or better than anybody and now I think you were sharing with us, Bill, that AB is looking at something more than a sales conference promotional tool, but to roll it out to all their tens of thousands of salespeople.<br /> <br />BILL:</p><p class="spiel"> That's exactly right and the opportunity for us is really to show them how to do that and take what we've done already to date and broaden that across more of their product lines. So for the sales rep he's going to get exposure to the high-end and what's right to sell, but also what's right to sell for the core brands - things like Budweiser and Bud Light - typical brands that you would expect. Now the broadness of what this can do is really going to give them an edge, I guess, and allow them to be that much more of an advisor out at retail.</p><p class="speaker"><br />RON:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel"> Helping our customers achieve their business objectives through the effective use of leading information technology. That sounds like somebody's mission statement. Ours by the way if you don't have it memorized yet. So, I just love it! What a fantastic success story. The combination here required -  the design skills absolutely are so important, the industrial-strength technology implementation and the process functional knowledge of the customer’s business - consumer packaged goods, the beer business, and specifically AB InBev - all pulled together with the Daugherty team and we delivered the goods. Great job guys. Let’s hit a couple of final points before we wrap up.<br /> <br />STEPHANIE:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel"> So I’d like to give a shout out to a couple of the other team members that helped us out:</p><p class="spiel"> Chris Passmore in marcom was a major hit in the UI/UX expertise; we had Alex Dees, we had Austin Moore and Dave Guidos all helping us do this application and it delivered on time.  RON</p><p class="speaker">RON:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel"> Sounds like a great team. Very good. Great job guys. George share with us a bit of the technology platform.<br /> <br />GEORGE:</p><p class="spiel"> Absolutely. So this is a native iOS application. It was written in Swift 4, which is the newest version, and it's the language that Apple is pushing for all developers to use. It's very great. We used the Azure product for sending out emails with sell sheets and storing the sell sheets in the cloud, as well as using Dropbox to receive assets from AB and sharing the application so that they can download and install the application.</p><p class="speaker"><br />RON:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel"> Very good. Great job all three of you and thanks for joining me today. Thanks for listening. We’ll talk to you soon.</p>
