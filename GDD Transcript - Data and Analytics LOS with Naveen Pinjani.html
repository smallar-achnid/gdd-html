<p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	Today, we'll be covering our very strategic data and analytics line of service, along with a number of great success stories and shout-outs from across the Daugherty enterprise. All this and more on today's episode of &quot;Good Day Daugherty.&quot;</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	And now for some updates from around the Daugherty enterprise. In Chicago, Daugherty will be providing project leadership for several critical initiatives at McDonald's stores over the next several months. Daugherty consultant Kathryn Elton-Westley will assist McDonald's as they look to construct a new showcase restaurant at their Chicago headquarters location, and this will highlight future restaurant innovations. Daugherty will also support McDonald's in the technology installation and set-up of their testing and innovation store in Romeoville. More than just simple remodels, Daugherty will be helping McDonald's bring in the next round of restaurant innovation to the masses. This is an exciting new area of exposure for our Daugherty team. </p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	In Dallas, last Friday, we met with the head of Toyota's IT Agile strategy and planning for North America to talk about areas where Daugherty could help with Agile and other enterprise strategies. We'll also be meeting with a Toyota product owner to talk about our capabilities in Agile analytics and big data and our strong experience in app dev. We'll be sharing some relevant client stories during the meeting, but also looking to understand more about Toyota's current needs and issues so that we can find areas to bring value to the client. And Terry Longhway, our client partner in Dallas, is helping us dig into this exciting new client for Daugherty.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	In Minneapolis, just recently, our Minneapolis office rolled out new ICAgile training to 23 of our consultants at the local office. A trio of Daugherty instructors led the ICAgile fundamentals class, Wes Strait from Minneapolis and Meegan Turnbeaugh and Ed Wehner from St. Louis. The group of 23 attendees are now certified Agile IC professionals — the first step on their ICAgile learning journey. This was a very successful first run and a new capability that will be very attractive to our clients in the Twin Cities and around the country. Good job, team there in Minneapolis.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	In St. Louis, earlier this month, nearly 30 of our St. Louis teammates, including myself, attended a celebration of the best places to work hosted by the St. Louis Business Journal. Hundreds of companies are nominated for this prestigious award every year, and Daugherty was one of the handful of companies to be selected as a finalist. The finalists are grouped by company size — small, medium, large and giant — and Daugherty was in the large category, and then ranked by an independent third party to determine the most employee-friendly workplaces in the area. Daugherty has now been recognized as one of the best places to work in St. Louis several years running, as well as around the enterprise, each of our cities has received recognition as a great place to work. I'm really proud of the team for that.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	In New York/New Jersey, we're actively searching for Daugherty office space and hiring a local Daugherty recruiter to help us lay the groundwork for growing our New York/New Jersey presence in 2018 and beyond very significantly. We're also starting to leverage relationships with existing Daugherty clients that have a presence in the New York/New Jersey area, like Charter, Mastercard, Anheuser-Busch, Macy's, Hudson's Bay and others. As you know, we've hired a local client partner, Scott Stein, to drive business development and support at Express Scripts and establish additional local client relationships. </p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	Things are going very well for us in our Atlanta office. I was just there for an Atlanta all-hands employee meeting. Really impressed with the team there. We continue to do great work with our existing clients and, this year, we'll be adding a number of new clients. In fact, we're planning to add 100 additional consultants to the Atlanta team in 2018 and I believe we can do it. In order to accomplish that, we'll be adding at least a couple of additional client partners to help us cover the landscape there in that great business city of Atlanta. Some very exciting things are going on around the Daugherty enterprise, thanks to all of you. I really appreciate it. Keep up the great work.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	I'm here today with one of our senior enterprise leaders, Naveen Pinjani. Naveen, if you don't mind, just introduce yourself and your role at Daugherty.</p><p class="speaker">Naveen Pinjani:</p><p class="spiel">	Sure. Sure, Ron. I play multiple roles at Daugherty, more lately then. One of the roles I play is, of course, lead the data and analytics COE under Dave, as well as, more recently, now I'm also responsible for the enterprise line of service lead for data and analytics here at Daugherty as well.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	Well, that's great. You've done a great job here, Naveen, and so you've taken on more responsibility. I appreciate that. But one of the things that we see in the marketplace is so much interest in attention being paid to data and analytics and, of course, it's very important to Daugherty. But what's going on out there? Why is there so much interest in this area?</p><p class="speaker">Naveen Pinjani:</p><p class="spiel">	Well, as we have seen lately, maybe more so in the last eight to 10 years, that everybody is in the business of data, whether be it retailers, whether be it financial companies, everyone needs to have access to large amounts of data, as well as be able to distill that data and make solid business decisions, and data and analytics capabilities help companies do that. In fact, a lot of times, I've heard CEOs mention that data and analytics is their key differentiator in the marketplace.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	Yeah. It's a differentiator. Data is being viewed as more of an asset. Companies are working to monetize in a more concrete manner.</p><p class="speaker">Naveen Pinjani:</p><p class="spiel">	Yep. Not only just monetization, but also utilizing data to improve now their performance, their products and how they engage with their customers as well.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	Yeah. That's a great distinction, the internal operational effectiveness in improving the way that they run their business, but also, very importantly, how they connect with their customers. And in the case of health care, that could be in the form of a patient, but the patient experience, customer experience, for a client of ours like Royal Caribbean, the experience of the passengers on the cruise ship. Gee, for Hyatt Hotels, it could be, of course, the experience of the guests and so on. But it's such an important thing, isn't it?</p><p class="speaker">Naveen Pinjani:</p><p class="spiel">	Yeah. And not only just the customers, I think companies are now focused on their partners as they conduct their business. For example, Express Scripts treats prescribers, doctors, insurance companies, also as their partners, and are utilizing data to enrich those relationships as well. </p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	Yeah, yeah. The business world has become more sophisticated, hasn't it? We think of extended supply chains and all that information and data and the Internet of things and mobile computing are contributing just truckloads of data, that's not a precise technical term, but significant additional quantities, and how to incorporate that into decision-making processes and new and better ways to interact with customers is so important.</p><p class="speaker">Naveen Pinjani:</p><p class="spiel">	Yes. In fact, data and analytics strategies have become now the cornerstone of a lot of the business strategies as well. I'll give you an example. Express Scripts, we were there last year, for almost a good part of last year, helping them formulate their data strategy. They sit on one of the largest, most rich data sets within the health care industry and, not only do they want to monetize it for their own value, but also help monetize it for the internal value that that data set brings. It's definitely a key part of that and, from what I hear, was actually one of the key differentiators in the whole Cigna acquisition as well. The other one is Ameripride. Ameripride, we helped them with their data strategy last year and the year before that.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	As we mention these, that's perfect, Naveen, because our customers, the entire marketplace, the entire world, cares about data and analytics and we have a lot to say about it. We have a point of view. We have experience. We have tremendous capabilities. And so these are some examples. Express Scripts is a great one, a wonderful credential. Any senior data and analytics leader in corporate America should be interested in hearing what we did. It's that caliber of an example.</p><p class="speaker">Naveen Pinjani:</p><p class="spiel">	Exactly. I'll add a little bit more to that. As part of the strategy, one of the concepts that we introduced was the concept of analytic governance, which, by the way, we are the industry leaders in that space. There's not a whole lot of companies that can even speak to analytic governance, and we are in the midst of starting a whole analytic governance program at Express Scripts.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	Wonderful. Who are some of the folks that helped you more locally or closer to the account versus the enterprise team?</p><p class="speaker">Naveen Pinjani:</p><p class="spiel">	Express Scripts, in my opinion, is a great example of the enterprise and local partnership. The model that we keep talking about was actually a manifestation of that. It was myself from the COE, but then the heavy lifting, actually, was done by the local brand from Drew Marco, Jared Mueller, Norm Carron, as well as we had assistance from Greg Becker as well.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	Yeah. Excellent. I know the team did a great job there. I've talked to the chief data officer myself a number of times who's shared his appreciation of the team's work. Good job on that.</p><p class="speaker">Naveen Pinjani:</p><p class="spiel">	Thank you.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	Okay. And so, let's see. Well, let's talk about some other examples then.</p><p class="speaker">Naveen Pinjani:</p><p class="spiel">	Oh, sure. In terms of the work that we're doing, across the board, you would see, for example in St. Louis, we are helping Monsanto do their transformation from their old ETL IM way of doing things to now a whole new model architecture. We're helping them do that with technologies like Kafka, technologies like Neo4j, so on. We are also helping even Express Scripts again in their pharm tech to wrangle large amounts of pharm tech operations data into Hadoop and then getting some valuable insights and reports out of that. In terms of-</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	Express Scripts, we think of that as St. Louis, but, well, let's give credit to Minneapolis and New York/New Jersey as well because this is an enterprise level of work across the entire Express Scripts organization. Okay. Good.</p><p class="speaker">Naveen Pinjani:</p><p class="spiel">	Then talking about Atlanta, Atlanta, we're doing a lot of good work at Delta. Amir, who's the line of service lead there as well as leading, not only just the regular data visualization Tableau reporting, there's a lot of that NPS reporting that we're doing there, but he's also now implementing predictive algorithms and machine learning using technologies like neural network to help them understand their customer behavior and their loyalty behavior, so that's a great example. Shout-out to Amir for all the good work that he's doing.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	Yeah, that's great. Predictive, prescriptive, machine learning, artificial intelligence, they're next steps that are picking up speed every day, aren't they? </p><p class="speaker">Naveen Pinjani:</p><p class="spiel">	Yes, and we do have those capabilities. And we do have those capabilities as well. Cox Communications in Atlanta, we are helping them transform their entire data platform into not only just new technologies, but also a new operating model. We're helping them move from their traditional IT development-centric model to a more services model, work that Sujit is doing over there in helping them transform to Agile is great. Really good quality work being done there. Minneapolis, the work that Tim Herby led for AmeriPride and now ... By the way, did you know that that body of work that was done has now enabled us to be a good contender for their entire IT transformation and IT integration work that Aramark is undertaking with AmeriPride.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	Well, that's a great measure of success. And so AmeriPride, let's see, remind me. The business of AmeriPride is ...</p><p class="speaker">Naveen Pinjani:</p><p class="spiel">	They were mostly into staff uniforms and maintenance of that, 500 million, a billion dollar organization, but now, because of all the good work that we did and they were sold to Aramark, now we have a 16 billion dollar client and an opportunity that, I think, has unlimited potential for us.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	That's great. What a great story that is. The Twin Cities and St. Louis and Franklin Lakes and Atlanta and, let's see, how about Dallas?</p><p class="speaker">Naveen Pinjani:</p><p class="spiel">	Dallas, that is interesting. It's a smaller branch, but the kind of work that we're doing is phenomenal, I think. Southwest-</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	Smaller, but growing fast. I know that's what everybody in Dallas is thinking right now and you're exactly right.</p><p class="speaker">Naveen Pinjani:</p><p class="spiel">	Go Dallas! I'm from Dallas, by the way. Dallas has been home for me.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	That's right. That's your hometown now.</p><p class="speaker">Naveen Pinjani:</p><p class="spiel">	Yes, yes. And it's quite unfortunate, I don't get to spend too much with the Dallas team as much as I spend on everyone else.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	And we appreciate that as well. We appreciate the ground you're covering.</p><p class="speaker">Naveen Pinjani:</p><p class="spiel">	Dallas, Southwest, I think it's one of the most modern airline. It's one of the best airline out there and they are thinking really hard on how they can reimagine the customer experience and we are helping them by evaluating new technologies, giving them new architectures in real time to improve their customer experience. We're also with involved GSK in Dallas. GSK is Glaxo. It's a pharmaceutical company.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	GlaxoSmithKline.</p><p class="speaker">Naveen Pinjani:</p><p class="spiel">	Yes. And they have created a one terabyte or maybe a couple of terabyte data lake, I think one of the biggest in the industry for the R&amp;D data, and we're helping them wrangle and get some structure around how they manage their tools and deployments there as well. There's really good work being done there.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	Very, very good. And then Chicago, we're doing some work at Allstate insurance, aren't we-</p><p class="speaker">Naveen Pinjani:</p><p class="spiel">	Yes.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	... that's on the leading edge of this data and analytics—</p><p class="speaker">Naveen Pinjani:</p><p class="spiel">	Yeah. Tom is leading that effort. They've set up an artificial intelligence and an RPA COE and they're contributing heavily into that area. Other than that, of course, Walgreens, we're doing a couple of projects in Hadoop. Kurt Janvrin is actually leading one of those. He's the local line-of-service lead there. As well as McDonald's, we have very key positions in their Customer 360, helping them understand how they engage with their customers in a digital fashion, so a lot of good work being done. And mostly on newer architectures like AWS, Azure, so on and so forth.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	A lot of exciting things going on around the Daugherty enterprise with data and analytics. How are we structured, Naveen, to address this? What does our data and analytics structure around the company look like?</p><p class="speaker">Naveen Pinjani:</p><p class="spiel">	Sure. A couple of changes that I think we will see in terms of better to streamline, to capture this big opportunity. Number one, of course, we've identified the role of a solution lead and an LOS lead, and the distinction is that a solution lead, for every market, there will be a data and analytics solution lead who will focus mostly on the customer, on understanding what the customer needs are, helping us frame better solutions, understand technology, and then implement that technology, while on the other side of the things would be more of your LOS responsibilities, which is capability development, training, career planning, reviews, so on and so forth. Now there will be corresponding roles on the enterprise side as well, which I would be leading, mostly to provide a consistency across all the branches, as well as fill in the gaps, if they exist, at the local level.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	And one of the reasons, Naveen, I believe that we're separating the solutions from the line of service side is so that some of our great teammates who are very strong in one area, client facing, but not as strong in another or vice versa, can step in and help us at a leadership level. And it's quite possible that the same person could head both areas, as you're doing, for the enterprise, but it gives us some more flexibility.</p><p class="speaker">Naveen Pinjani:</p><p class="spiel">	Exactly. And not only that, there are additional changes that we are discussing right now is the distinction between ... In fact, we're coming up with better career tracks for our consultants, in terms of there's a whole track on data, data management, data engineering or your classical, traditional IM stuff, and then there's a parallel track that we are working on for the analytics work that is done to lead up to a more data scientist kind of a role. We're going to streamline those two career paths to add more value to our customers and better manage the talent.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	Very important. So many interesting things with data and analytics going on around the company and one of those things is the Gateway To Innovation conference. Now the Gateway To Innovation conference is here in St. Louis. It's a large regional technology and business conference attended by most of the senior technology leaders and many of the senior business people in the region and a great opportunity to showcase expertise and thought leadership and network and Daugherty is playing a significant role in a couple of ways here this year and one is in the data and analytics area. What are we doing in that area?</p><p class="speaker">Naveen Pinjani:</p><p class="spiel">	Sure. Daugherty is moderating a panel discussion with some of the very key leaders within the St. Louis market in data and analytics space. I think the topic of discussion is-</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	I heard we had a really good moderator, Naveen. Who is it? [laughing] It's you, isn't it? Yeah, yeah.</p><p class="speaker">Naveen Pinjani:</p><p class="spiel">	Well, thank you, Ron. Thank you. The participants, or the panelists, are the who's who of data and analytics in St. Louis. You have the chief data officer for a Fortune 20 company, Express Scripts, Tom Henry will be joining us. Abby Doolittle, she's the VP over analytics at RGAx and then Naveen Singla from Monsanto, who's also a VP over analytics and leads their data science program globally. These are the panelists and the topic we will be discussing would be the next level of data and analytics, where is it headed to, how do we get to the next level.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	Yeah, that's great. And I believe we're already anticipating a full house, a sold-out room.</p><p class="speaker">Naveen Pinjani:</p><p class="spiel">	Let's hope so.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	It's such a good thing for us and even though this example is in St. Louis and for this region here, it's exactly the sort of thing that we want to do everywhere, showcase our expertise, our capabilities, work collaboratively with some of our most important and well-known clients in the area and position ourselves as a leader for everyone to see.</p><p class="speaker">Naveen Pinjani:</p><p class="spiel">	Yeah. That's more at the executive level, but I'll give you another good story that I would like to share is the work that David Street, here in St. Louis, is doing with the Data Governance Council for St. Louis. What he's done is he's leading this group of all the data governance leaders within St. Louis, brings them in together for an open discussion on how to implement data governance, any kind of challenges, and provide thought leadership to that group. That's done, not only at the executive, but also at the lower levels as well.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	Oh, that's good for so many reasons, isn't it? Wonderful. Great work on that, David. And, Naveen, nice job. Thanks for joining me today.</p><p class="speaker">Naveen Pinjani:</p><p class="spiel">	Thank you, Ron.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel">	All right. And thanks for listening, everybody. We'll talk to you soon. </p>
