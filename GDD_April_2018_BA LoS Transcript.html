<p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	We have a very interesting and informative discussion with two of our leaders in the business alignment line of service today. Also, some important anniversaries and some company highlight from around the Daugherty Enterprise. All this and you guessed it, even more, on today's episode of Good Day, Daugherty. </p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	I'd like to share with everyone and congratulate our teammates on April anniversaries. In St. Louis, Drew Florian has been with the company for 10 years. Jason Hammock for five years. Sandra Kelly, Matthew Connors, Matt Fornie, and Dan Johnson all also for five years with the company. Congratulations, everyone. In the Twin Cities, Lisa Carlston and Tara Block have both been with Daugherty for five years, and in Chicago, Lee Haskel has been with the company for five years. Congratulations, everyone. I really appreciate all that you've done for Daugherty during your time here. </p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	Recently in St. Louis, we participated in two very significant hack-a-thons. I'm going to share some details with you about the first of those at Monsanto and then next time, I'll give you some more information about the Express Scripts hack-a-thon. At Monsanto, this was the first ever data science and global supply chain hack-a-thon. Primary goal of this month-long competition was to assess the impact of a prospective new technology in Monsanto's fields. Overall, our team did an exceptional job, impressed Monsanto leadership, and since we were the only team that was composed entirely of consultants, our team had to do this work on their own time, which is exemplary performance. </p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	Dan Brown, Nathan Brown, David Gidos, Kyle Schenthal, and Rommel Villagomez were on our Daugherty team. Excellent job by the team. We impressed the customer and delivered an outstanding result. Great job. </p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	In Atlanta, this year marks Daugherty's eighth year of partnership with Hyatt as the managed services provider for their proprietary revenue management system, PRIO, Price, Revenue, and Inventory Optimization. PRIO is one of the only wholly outsourced business systems within Hyatt's IT portfolio, and Daugherty has continued to show the value we can bring through ongoing updates and enhancements because of their success with PRIO, our Hyatt team is now preparing to embark on a group forecasting and pricing initiative to bring modern revenue management technology and analytics to a customer segment that represents 40% of Hyatt's business. This new project will be as strategic and transformational as the original PRIO project. </p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	I don't have everyone's name in front of me on the Hyatt team, but I know that John Dewitt is one of our exceptional leaders there in Atlanta who's helped us for a number of years with Hyatt. Congratulations, John, and congratulations to the entire Hyatt team. Great work. </p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	In Chicago, we're kicking off an engagement with Allstate's roadside assistance team. Daugherty consultants Mary Turczynski and Khajana Kumar will be working with Allstate to enhance reporting and analytics for a number of key initiatives within the organization. This will be a great opportunity for us to showcase a combination of our data and analytics expertise as well as our Tableau development skills in an area of significant importance to Allstate. </p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	In Dallas, we continue to make progress at both AT&amp;T and Toyota, specifically at Toyota, we've been named to the approved vendor list, a great step forward. We procured a meeting with Toyota's vendor management group to give them an overview of our capabilities and a deep dive into some of the work that we're doing in the area of data and analytics, with the support of Naveen Pinjani. The conversation went very well and they've given us a nondisclosure to sign, so that we can have an even more in-depth discussion. </p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	In addition, Daugherty's own Armel Maembel competed in the U.S. Open Karate Championships in Las Vegas and took home the silver medal. This is a great accomplishment as this yearly competition brings talent from all around the country. That really is exceptional. Congratulations, Armel. </p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	In Minneapolis, Daugherty's proposed a pilot with Medtronic to utilize our development center to manage a backlog of small projects, allowing Medtronic more flexibility with ramping up and ramping down based on demand. Medtronic's development organization struggled to find a way to deliver small but important projects quickly as their organization is scaled primarily for large project teams. This is a completely new way for Medtronic to engage Daugherty and we're very excited about the opportunity to demonstrate the value of our development center model. Great job there, Minneapolis. </p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	In New York, New Jersey, Daugherty consultant Sohini Lakhwani recently completed an effort to develop a better process of handling work requests that come in to the drug utilization review team at Express Scripts. Sohini was able to identify inefficiencies in the current processes and map out a future state that has led to an 80% reduction in the team's work backlog while increasing customer satisfaction. Wow. The new ticket handling process was very well received by Express Scripts leadership and has created even more opportunity for our Daugherty team there. Congratulations, Sohini. </p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	Great work, everyone, all around the enterprise. I'm so impressed with the work we're doing and it's the foundation that we build on for everything else we do here at Daugherty. Great job. </p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	I'm very excited to spend some time today covering our business alignment line of service, and we have two of our leaders with us in this line of service, Robin Mirly, Phil Delanty, and you might be asking yourself, what is the business alignment line of service? Let's start by clarifying that. Robin, if you don't mind, just help us understand the evolution of this line of service a bit. </p><p class="speaker">Robin Mirly:</p><p class="spiel">	Sure, Ron. Thanks for having me today. </p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	Sure. </p><p class="speaker">Robin Mirly:</p><p class="spiel">	The line of service started out as business analysis, and then it transitioned to business architecture and analysis, and now we've aligned to business alignment to kind of recognize the importance and how critical the roles are and the relationships that we build with the business. We currently still have the business analysts and architect roles. However, we've supplemented with some new roles, like product owner, product manager, a few other organizational change consultant, so that's what we're going to be talking about today. </p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	All right. That's great. That's a great description and so we haven't really eliminated anything. </p><p class="speaker">Robin Mirly:</p><p class="spiel">	Not at all. </p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	We've broadened and we've added to as technology has evolved, as agile has entered the picture more and more, so there's essentially more opportunity here than before, and I think what you were pointing out is that this very important role, business analyst, as it's evolved, is still there, but business alignment indicates and even more significance with respect to working with the customer, the stakeholder, and ensuring that we're building the right thing. </p><p class="speaker">Robin Mirly:</p><p class="spiel">	That's correct. </p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	Okay. Very good. Phil, with respect to the broadening evolution of the business alignment line of service, there are some new roles, like product owner, product manager, and sometimes it's not always crystal clear what those are. Could you help us understand that? </p><p class="speaker">Phil Delanty:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel">	Sure. First starting with product owner and product manager, those are usually considered in industry two separate roles. The product owner role is usually one focused on agile development efforts. The own who owns the product backlog who gets involved in prioritizing what gets included in the next iteration or next sprint. Product manager is a different role traditionally, where they get involved in things like over leading a product ownership effort or within regards to it [inaudible 00:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel">09:</p><p class="spiel">07], they can be involved in things like strategic planning for their product. The future roadmap for enhancements for that product, looking at the competitive environment for that product and making sure that the product is updated accordingly. </p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	Okay, and so product owner, product manager, those are a couple of options for a business analyst to grow or evolve into if they so choose. </p><p class="speaker">Phil Delanty:</p><p class="spiel">	Yes, and we're already doing that. I can cite some examples at the Home Depot, we have a set of product managers, some product owners that are working for us that can say specifically Mark Townsend is working as the product manager over the digital asset platform product, and in that regard, he's responsible for all the things I just mentioned. Keeping tabs on what gets in and out of that platform and in that regard, he has been able to identify several opportunities for us, Daugherty, to get involved in some of the projects that are affecting his product. It's a great way for us to get exposure to some opportunities for us that are client sites. </p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	Yeah. Very good. It's a great example. If we look at the group of business analysts that we've had in the company, then we've already, I believe, started to invest in the development of those folks, helping them grow into product owner, product managers, just help me understand that a little bit better. How are we doing that? What's required? Maybe give me an example of someone who's progressed along that path. </p><p class="speaker">Robin Mirly:</p><p class="spiel">	I have a great example. Sarah Connors is currently at RGAX, a client in St. Louis. She actually started a mark on group here in the corporate office, transitioned to consulting. She's been at RGAX now for about a year. She went in as a BA to help an agile team with user stories and QA. She was able to successfully build relationships with the product owner who has since been promoted within RGAX, and relationships with the CEO of RGAX. She now acts as the proxy for that product owner and helps with the strategic development of the product that they're working on, she started from the very beginning and then worked her way through and then built her skillset and evolved into this really awesome consultant. </p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	What a great example. Sarah did a podcast here.</p><p class="speaker">Robin Mirly:</p><p class="spiel">	She did. You did speak with her. </p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	Yeah. Wonderful. That's a great example. How about you, Phil? </p><p class="speaker">Phil Delanty:</p><p class="spiel">	Yeah. Just to make sure that we were going to be ready for this trend of uptake and product ownership and product management, a couple of years ago, we started putting the curricula in place to support that, so we have the set of product owner focused classes, lectures, and labs, to give our business analysts the least base toolkit that you need to be successful in that role, so we started implementing those a couple of years ago and now in Atlanta, we've got 100% coverage in that training so that any BA who gets the bench between projects might be a good candidate for a product owner role going forward. </p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	That's excellent. Congratulations on that. Love to hear it. </p><p class="speaker">Robin Mirly:</p><p class="spiel">	I'd like to piggyback on that for just a second. I think there have been some communications around the IC Agile partnership that we have, so to kind of build on top of the training on that product owner, we're now very soon will be offering certification around that, as well, to help our clients recognize that we all have consistent learning objectives and have a consistent vision around that role. </p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	That's great. Certification for a product owner, product manager. </p><p class="speaker">Robin Mirly:</p><p class="spiel">	That's correct. </p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	Associated with the IC agile training that we're doing. </p><p class="speaker">Robin Mirly:</p><p class="spiel">	That's correct. </p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	That's excellent. Excellent. One thing that can be confusing is that on a particular project or program, we don't have a business analyst or a product manager or a product owner, might we have all those associated with the same project? </p><p class="speaker">Robin Mirly:</p><p class="spiel">	We could. For example, I mentioned Sarah Connors. She works on a project with a product owner. Initially, like I said, going in to develop user stories and works very closely with the product owner, who then in turn works very closely with the business stakeholders to help align to the vision of the product and then they work collaboratively, then with the development team to ensure that's what's being delivered meets the expectations of the vision.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	What is her role called? </p><p class="speaker">Robin Mirly:</p><p class="spiel">	Her role as a, she's a business architect. She's actually a business architect but she functions. We wear many hats as a BA and a proxy for the product owner. </p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	That's a really important point that with our growing, evolving, expanding world of opportunity in so many ways, the fact that some of these things are new and that Daugherty is right at the forefront is not an accident. That's where we want to be. That's where we want to be for so many reasons. We don't want to be laggard followers. We want to be on the leading front, and so that gives us an opportunity not only to have interesting work for our people to do and developmental opportunities, but also allows us to be in an advisory role with our clients, who are trying to figure this out and evolve and move themselves. </p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	Let me step back for just a second, Robin, you mentioned a business architect role. Phil, what are some of the differences between a business architect, a business analyst, and then maybe any other roles that are relatively new in this business alignment line of service? </p><p class="speaker">Phil Delanty:</p><p class="spiel">	Sure. A business analyst is one you can traditionally relate to doing project requirements documentation, business process, improving definition, and documentation, helping out our traditional RPM types of projects. Whereas a business architect is usually, if they're involved in that type of project, they're usually the one that's facilitating the discussion. They're also getting involved in things that are higher level types of discussions within the enterprise, like enterprise organizational level capability modeling and mapping, identifying gaps in an organization's capability set, and how those gaps could best be filled, high-level process improvement across departments and organizations, that type of thing is where business architect really comes to the forefront. A business analyst is a forward step process. </p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	Okay. That's a great description. No, no. That's a great description and so the two roles are complementary. </p><p class="speaker">Phil Delanty:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel">	Yes. They're complementary roles and you asked about some of the other roles that we've got in place that are coming forward, and a big one that we're really excited about are the roles associated with user interface and user experience. We're going to have three new roles, user interface designer, user experience architect, and senior user experience architect, in place very soon. As a matter of fact, in Atlanta, we've actually recently hired a senior user experience architect, Ralph Lord, who's going to help us not only with our clients in the UI UX space but also build our [inaudible 00:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel">16:</p><p class="spiel">32] in this space. It's an area that we've really wanted to improve on for the last several years and now we're getting some traction in that space and we're really excited about getting involved in all things UI UX, not just user interface design, but also bringing user experience elements to process improvement, just customer-focused design. </p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	Customer-focused design. That's a pretty important thing, isn't it? Just becoming more important every day. That's great information. Now, some of you out there may be thinking holy cow, that's really great stuff they're doing in Atlanta or in St. Louis. You might be in another part of the organization or you might even be in one of those business units, but not be aware of some of these things. One of the reasons I do these podcasts is just to get more information out there, then we might not be able to answer every question but we can start the conversation. Make sure you follow through if you'd like to know more about what we're doing and the user experience area, and even what opportunities might be available to you. That's really good. Great information.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	Now, with this evolution that we've been talking about, some of the new roles, new responsibilities, new ways of interacting and complementing each other these roles have, where have we been helping customers understand these things? Being an advisor and helping them go through their evolution. Are there any examples that come to mind in St. Louis? </p><p class="speaker">Robin Mirly:</p><p class="spiel">	Absolutely. Rabo AgriFinance, we are kicking off the direct lending effort there, very excited about it. </p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	That's a big win.</p><p class="speaker">Robin Mirly:</p><p class="spiel">	It is a big one.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	I just met with the president of Rabo, just had lunch with him and a couple of other senior leaders last week. </p><p class="speaker">Robin Mirly:</p><p class="spiel">	Very exciting. Right? </p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	We agree. </p><p class="speaker">Robin Mirly:</p><p class="spiel">	We love it. We have architect and a BA, Chad Mitchell, very excited to have Chad on the team working with corporate. They've asked us to help with their digital transformation of their affluent group of customers, which means what that means is when they borrow money, it's tens of billion dollars at a time, so there's a pretty high focus on that group, and so we'll be doing gap analysis, process improvement, as well as working with the product owner to streamline and improve the process for that specific customer as well as their employees, so they're not just customer-focused, which is exciting. </p><p class="speaker">Robin Mirly:</p><p class="spiel">	They're also dedicated to helping the process, improving the process for their employees. </p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	Oh, that's excellent. I believe John Gobble is our engagement manager. </p><p class="speaker">Robin Mirly:</p><p class="spiel">	He's the engagement manager there. </p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	An excellent team. I know they've done great work, as is so often the case when we do really good work for our customers that opens things up for us to do even more. Here's a wonderful example. When I spoke with the president of Rabo, that was front and center. Daugherty has done great work for us, you understand us, we trust us, this is a really important next step that we're taking, and even though the board is sort of looking around at some of the bigger name companies, we know Daugherty can get the job done for us. </p><p class="speaker">Robin Mirly:</p><p class="spiel">	They have built great relationships there. Have done a really good job. </p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	Very good. Phil, what about in Atlanta? </p><p class="speaker">Phil Delanty:</p><p class="spiel">	Yeah. We've been involved in helping our clients transform within the product owner, product manager, or just generally agile at Cox and at Home Depot. Our early product owners and product managers in those spaces were also coaches to help the client understand more what those roles were about and how best to execute within those roles. </p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	Okay. All right. Very, very good, and so the Cox and Home Depot and I know that we have Dan O'Keeffe is the client partner there at Cox as well as our managing director in Atlanta. He's still acting as a client partner and he has a number of good leaders working for him. Rob Simmons and Kailash are two of those folks and then the Home Depot, we have Jim Johnson, who's our client partner for a couple of very strong leaders that Chris and Michael there in the engagement management roles. </p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	Just wonderful and evolution of our business as we continue to grow and build and add and help our clients. Good examples. Thanks for sharing those. One more thing I'd like to touch on. One of the things that differentiates us as a business is our proprietary processes and tools and techniques that we can use to help our clients. Right at the center of that is RPM, and so RPM must evolve as the industry evolves, but has it been evolving? What are we doing RPM? Is it still relevant? </p><p class="speaker">Phil Delanty:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel">	Absolutely. RPM is still very relevant, [inaudible 00:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel">21:</p><p class="spiel">44] space at. We're doing work at RPM space at Cox, at Serta Simmons, at the Home Depot. We've done a lot of work in the RPM space. It still keeps the lights on and it has matured over the years, so sure, we have the original traditional RPM techniques we've been using to help design and build systems, but then we've augmented that over time with an approach that is more scrum-based, RPM scrum. We brought in the leading tenants, so we have RPM lean. We've gotten even more agile and work with things like how to skip use cases and traditional requirements altogether and jump straight into just enough elaboration to get an agile team working. That's RPM sprint zero. </p><p class="speaker">Phil Delanty:</p><p class="spiel">	RPM has definitely matured over the years, is still really exciting. I got to give a big shout out to the teams that have been doing this at Cox for the last three or four years straight. Jeff Bigbie and Brian Crenshaw and their teams have been, are so successful there that they get called out by named and requested in advance for when their project ends, can they get involved in the next project, so RPM is still very relevant and I'm very excited that we're still involved in that space. </p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	Fantastic. Great information and a great update there. Rob and Phil, you've done a wonderful job. Thanks for joining me today. </p><p class="speaker">Robin Mirly:</p><p class="spiel">	Thanks for having me. </p><p class="speaker">Phil Delanty:</p><p class="spiel">	Thank you, Ron. </p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel">	Yeah. Really appreciate it. Really appreciate it. This was a very interesting podcast for me, and I know we've mentioned a number of clients at a number of our great leaders in the business alignment line of service, but it's just impossible to mention everyone because we have so many wonderful teammates out there, and I want you to know we appreciate you all. Thanks so much and thanks for listening. We'll talk to you soon. </p>
