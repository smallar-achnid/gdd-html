<p class="speaker">RON INTRO:</p><p class="spiel"> You’ll be hearing about a very interesting and strategic engagement today. One that is helping to grow and transform two different industry segments. Plus, updates from around the company. It is only the second week of the year, but we already have plenty to share. All this and more on today’s episode of Good Day Daugherty. </p><p class="spiel"> RON</p><p class="speaker">RON:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel"> I have a number of success stories to share with you today and I’d like for you to think about this a couple of ways. One:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel"> you’re hearing about a success story, a successful engagement or successful work we have delivered to the customer and consider how that relates to your customer and your account; how it might be useful to you, what would be a lesson learned or how to bring some thought leadership to your customer to share. Consider how someone else has solved a similar problem. Two:</p><p class="spiel"> with respect to work you’re doing or have done, is there something you could take to the team that is presenting their engagement on the podcast? Think about how we can help each other.  </p><p class="spiel">This month we are already kicking off two exciting projects at McDonald’s. We will be leading the technology deployment program that focuses on addressing the pain points of restaurant owners/operators, and there are a lot of those around the world. During IT deployment, we will be helping to install a comprehensive change management model and establishing consistent communication roles and responsibilities across all US regions. Secondly, we will be leading the analysis and reporting for the CSM reduction task force, that’s Cases Store Month – an internal McDonald’s group who’s focus is to reduce the number of IT help desk cases. Our analysis and reporting will be instrumental in the group’s progress reports to McDonald’s restaurant technology board comprised of restaurant owner/operators. We’re also driving toward more application development work in Chicago in 2018 – love that! Specifically targeting the Allstate account. We are focused on continued growth in our information management engagements, targeting Tableau development but also focused on data analysis, modeling and architecture in the cloud. Wow, go Chicago! </p><p class="spiel"> </p><p class="spiel">In Dallas, we are continuing to build our relationship at Southwest Airlines. We are proposing a SAFe implementation at Southwest based on all the experience Daugherty has in this Agile space. We are also growing our team at GSK. Our Engagement Manager, Bryant Robinson has done a great job of framing up program level needs. So, we are adding a consultant, Cristy Kubacak. Way to go Bryant and Cristy!</p><p class="spiel"> </p><p class="spiel">Ok, on to St. Louis. In the coming days, we will be announcing a partnership with FinLocker. They are an innovator in the financial services space and a new client of Daugherty’s. We are designing and developing a new financial management product that could be a game changer in the mortgage industry and personal financial management space. The first version of the product is scheduled to deploy in the second quarter of 2018. In addition to securing the new partnership with FinLocker, we are actively working to expand our client footprint in St. Louis by pursuing work at new clients, such as Wells Fargo, Ascension Health, Enterprise Rent-A-Car, Graybar and several others. Sounds great!</p><p class="spiel"><br />Atlanta is off to a great start in 2018. Extensions, renewals in many strategic accounts. The goal for Atlanta in 2018 is to reach 200 billable consultants, which would represent over 33% growth. In January alone, that branch will be adding 10 consultants already, so they are off to a great start. That LOS growth for Atlanta will be across the board with a primary emphasis on SA&amp;E capabilities with a focus on the Development Center work. Atlanta is also taking the lead on building out UI, UX and product management capabilities to support client demand. </p><p class="spiel"> </p><p class="spiel">In Minneapolis, we are working to accelerate the career growth of high potential employees and key leadership roles to help support the business as a key initiative in 2018. So, from a client relationship perspective, Rob and Virginia have set up meetings with the Medtronic CIO, as well as his direct reports, to broaden our reach within the Medtronic account. Robin is also driving new relationships within our Best Buy account, creating more strategic work as well as growing our presence in BestBuy.com through our SA&amp;E LOS. Great job Robin.</p><p class="spiel"> </p><p class="spiel">So many great things going on and so much positive momentum is being built already, and we’re just getting started. Thanks to all of you for your great work. It’s very much appreciated.</p><p class="spiel"> RON</p><p class="speaker">RON:</p><p class="spiel"> We have a very interesting and strategic engagement that we are excited to share with you today. Eric and Sarah, if you don’t mind, please introduce yourselves.  ERIC</p><p class="speaker">ERIC:</p><p class="spiel"> Yes, my name is Eric Rybczynski. I’ve been with Daugherty for a little over one and a half years. In that time, I’ve had the opportunity to work at three clients. The first was Centene, then Monsanto, and now I’m at RGAx which is a subsidiary of RGA. RON</p><p class="speaker">RON:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel"> Wonderful.<br /> <br />SARAH:</p><p class="spiel"> My name is Sarah Conners. I’ve been at Daugherty for about ten years. I worked in Marcom first for a few years and then moved into consulting. I did about five years down at AB and had a lot of fun. About a year ago I moved to RGA. We are doing some exciting work down there.</p><p class="speaker">RON:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel"> That’s great. That’s a bit of a different career path than most of us and it’s a great one too. We were just joking about one of our Marcom people made good here, so we’re really proud of that. Fantastic. So, you’ve been working with RGA how long now?<br /> <br />SARAH:</p><p class="spiel"> Just one year.  RON</p><p class="speaker">RON:</p><p class="spiel"> Okay. If you don’t mind why don’t you tell us a bit more. RGA, RGAx…what is that company? SARAH</p><p class="speaker">SARAH:</p><p class="spiel"> Yeah. So RGA is Reinsurance Group of America. Daugherty has been working there for about a decade now and we have 35 consultants now. About a third of those are in RGAx. Now, just to talk a bit about what is RGA versus RGAx. RGA, you know, reinsurances insures.  RON</p><p class="speaker">RON:</p><p class="spiel"> Say that five times fast! SARAH</p><p class="speaker">SARAH:</p><p class="spiel"> So, an insurance company, when they sell a policy they are also wanting to mitigate their risk so they buy insurance on that insurance policy. RGA is the kind of company that sells that policy to them. RGAx, on the other hand, is this wholly owned subsidiary; the innovation arm of RGA. They’re really focused on growing and accelerating the market for insurance. They are taking innovation and technology and seeing how insurance carriers can be more effective in selling insurance, growing that market, and of course then RGA can insure more insurance. So, it is a win-win – it’s a win for the carriers, RGA’s core clients, and it’s a win for RGA as well.  RON</p><p class="speaker">RON:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel"> That’s really interesting. So, a company that’s innovation and technology focused, whose mission is to expand the marketplace for two industry segments:</p><p class="spiel"> insurers and reinsurers. That’s quite a thing…and we’re helping them do it! Good. Let’s talk a bit more about what that business problem looks like. ERIC</p><p class="speaker">ERIC:</p><p class="spiel"> Yeah, so RGAx is looking to grow the space. In order to grow the insurance market, you need to identify what new products can we offer in that space and what are the new or different ways we can offer those products? RGAx, as well as RGA, partner with direct insurance carriers and work with start-ups as well, trying to… RON</p><p class="speaker">RON:</p><p class="spiel"> So, a big part of this Eric, let me make sure I understand, is to make the products more accessible digitally? That’s the primary focus isn’t it, to sell through a digital channel? Let’s talk a little bit more about that. How are we helping? ERIC</p><p class="speaker">ERIC:</p><p class="spiel"> So, Daugherty is helping on this initiative, and both Sarah and I are on that team, as well as nine others. Working with an existing development pod that we already had at RGA, we were able to pivot that team to work on this project in order to get this product completed and to market quickly. I can let Sarah speak to the specifics of what that dev pod is doing for this initiative. RON</p><p class="speaker">RON:</p><p class="spiel"> Okay, fantastic.  SARAH</p><p class="speaker">SARAH:</p><p class="spiel"> So, the dev pod that was already there had three software engineers on it, we had a technical architect, we had two BAs – myself and one additional BA who is performing a QA role there. Like Eric said, we were already there working on a project that was sort of entering a maintenance phase when this project came along and they asked if we could pivot and really stand up the consumer front end and do the integration between the lead generation partner and the policy administrator partner. As this need arose and we scoped the work, we added an additional software engineer to the team so there were four. We found that there was a lot of configuration and a lot of requirements around the policy administration so we added another BA as well. So, we are definitely working well as a team there. In addition to that, we have been very successful with the UI/UX person we have as well. She has been responsible for the application journey, creating the forms so they are user friendly, and really putting the customer first instead of looking at all of the regulations and putting that first.  RON</p><p class="speaker">RON:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel"> To make it easier to apply for a life insurance policy online then?<br /> <br />SARAH:</p><p class="spiel"> Absolutely.  ERIC</p><p class="speaker">ERIC:</p><p class="spiel"> To make it a more enjoyable journey as well.</p><p class="speaker"><br />RON:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel"> I think you mentioned to me earlier something about some strategic partnerships. So, without mentioning any names or getting into any specifics here, the idea of having a fitness company like Fitbit here partner with RGAx, so when I’m checking my app to see if I slept well last night a message could come up like, “Hey you’re a pretty good sleeper, therefore we’ll offer you a discount on life insurance. Very strategic and a very important engagement, I can tell. What were some of the Daugherty differentiators? What allowed us to set ourselves apart during this engagement?<br /> <br />ERIC:</p><p class="spiel"> Yeah, Ron, I think what really set Daugherty apart was the ability to be flexible and the ability to be Agile. We were able to move quickly to address a customer need. In this specific strategic engagement, we put forward a very comprehensive team to deliver. For example, me working as a program manager on the business side of the space, we have a significant dev pod team building out the application and portal functionality for the initial product. That team includes Sarah and Matt Heironimus as the technical architect. The developers were Mike Taylor, Zach Wolfe, David Vandenburg, Ethan Davis; QA from Michael Nguyen. Two BAs supporting the project in Lori Dailey and Adrian D’Souza. Across any other support sites, we had Julia Dinh providing her UX expertise, so if you look right there we are providing a comprehensive solution; showing that Daugherty can play in this space in all functions to provide a comprehensive solution and address any need the customer may have. In this case, addressing a very strategic initiative for RGAx. RON</p><p class="speaker">RON:</p><p class="spiel"> Wonderful. It sounds like you pulled together the A-team for this thing. SARAH</p><p class="speaker">SARAH:</p><p class="spiel"> I would say that’ s one of the things that has stood out to our client. We have incredible team cohesion, we work together well, there’s a lot of collaboration that happens, there are ideas that are challenged and respected within the team so we come up with the best ideas and not just one person’s idea. I think they really like our thought leadership in that space. You know, the biggest thing they ask us is, “Is this persona a good fit?” when we add someone to the team. They ask us to evaluate if it is someone that we want to continue to work with. It works that we are bringing in more Daugherty teammates because Daugherty has a great hiring model, so that works really well for us. RON</p><p class="speaker">RON:</p><p class="spiel"> Those are some great points. Not only wonderful team members, but thought leadership behaving like professional consultants and working cohesively as a team providing a comprehensive solution. You know, the way we behave and the way we work is so much more important than the way the contract is written. So, you know, it may or may not have been planned for Daugherty to take the whole thing on as a fixed price contract, but we took ownership, we brought thought leadership, we behaved as a team, and the customer loved it. What a great success story. Thanks for joining me to share and maybe in a future podcast we can do a demo for everybody.<br /> <br /></p><p class="speaker">SARAH &amp; ERIC:</p><p class="spiel"> Absolutely!
