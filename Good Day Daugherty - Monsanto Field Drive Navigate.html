<p class="speaker">RON:</p><p class="spiel"> We have a great demo to share with you today where we’re using some leading edge technology to drive millions of dollars of business value for an important customer. Some company shout outs and some highlights from around the Enterprise. All this and more on today's episode of Good Day Daugherty. RON</p><p class="speaker">RON:</p><p class="spiel"> I'd like to share some highlights and more from around the company. There are a lot of great things going on. We've added a new customer in Minneapolis, Compeer Financial. Compeer was formed by the merger of three state-based agribanks and has about eighteen and a half billion in loan and lease assets. We’re going to be playing a key role in the integration of these three organizations. A big thanks here to Brian Krueger, one of our consultants in Minneapolis who helped broker this introduction. An exciting win. In Chicago we have an interesting win at Walgreens. We won a six-month engagement to guide the Walgreens IT Loyalty Refresh Program team through an Agile transformation journey - really interesting stuff. We've kicked off that work. Also in Chicago, Daugherty was a gold sponsor for an event called The Power of the Purse. This was an event done in conjunction with the United Way of Lake County. Coleen, Deb, and some other powerful Chicago businesswomen attended and thousands of dollars were raised to help support early childhood literacy programs in Lake County. In St. Louis we had an interesting win at Anheuser-Busch because we won based on not only on our great software development capabilities, but also our user interface capabilities and design capabilities. AB for this particular kind of work had been leaning on design and marketing firms, and Daugherty stepped in and out positioned and showed greater capabilities than those firms. Really good win. So, shout outs to the development team of David Guidos, George Lejnine, Alex Dees, Stephanie Lawrence and Chris Passmore who led our user interface development work. Really, really good work here and interestingly as we’re talking about our Marcom and marketing capabilities – our Marcom team submitted some public facing work that we've done to the Marcom Awards organization and Daugherty won gold in the print design category. So, wonderful capabilities that we have and are continuing to build in our marketing organization. I want everyone to be aware of that so you can recognize that that's a capability that Daugherty has to help our customers. In Atlanta we continue to grow the Cox account with over 25% consultant growth this year. Recently we hosted a Cox enterprise data services leadership team meeting at our Daugherty offices in Atlanta for a three-day workshop. Great stuff. In Dallas at Southwest Airlines we continue to help Southwest plan their systems and data movement to the cloud, and the team did such excellent work there in Dallas that we’re helping Southwest move to through an entire company-wide transformation. A special shout out to Mike Trombley and David Carpenter who helped craft the proposal. Great work all around the company. Keep up the great work and we’ll keep sharing the highlights.  RON</p><p class="speaker">RON:</p><p class="spiel"> We have a very interesting application we’re going to share with you today. It’s some great work we've done for Monsanto Company. Let's jump right in and start with some introductions. ERIC</p><p class="speaker">ERIC:</p><p class="spiel"> Hi everyone. Eric Siboda here. I have been with Daugherty for seven and a half years and I am currently the Engagement Manager over everything we do with Monsanto.  MATT</p><p class="speaker">MATT:</p><p class="spiel"> I’m Matt Cronin and I’ve been a developer here at Daugherty for a little over a year now. I might also like to bring up that a couple developers we worked alongside with are Brigita Martin and Sam Nelson. We also had Marianne Erickson as BA and Matt Henroid as Team Lead. RON</p><p class="speaker">RON:</p><p class="spiel"> Okay that's great. Now let’s talk about the application. Eric what’s this application called? ERIC</p><p class="speaker">ERIC:</p><p class="spiel"> It’s called Field Drive Navigate. RON</p><p class="speaker">RON:</p><p class="spiel"> Alright – share some of the business context with us if you would please. ERIC</p><p class="speaker">ERIC:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel"> Sure. The Monsanto business has a challenge in Central and South America - you can consider developing countries - in the sense that where they farm and harvest their crop and where they have to ship that crop, as far as the production facility, is such combined with the climate and the seed can actually heat up and spoil during transportation out to the production facility. That mounts into millions of dollars in revenue lost every single year when you consider Argentina and South America.<br /> <br />RON:</p><p class="spiel"> Alright, very interesting. Matt can you tell us a little bit more about how this application works?  MATT</p><p class="speaker"> MATT:</p><p class="spiel"> Absolutely. So basically we have IOT devices in South America that Monsanto installs in these trucks. The trucks send out information to cell providers in South America. South America cell provider send that data to Monsanto and we consume that information and display it on the screen. So where Navigate comes in is that it consumes and displays that information on the screen. RON</p><p class="speaker">RON:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel"> Interesting. So are there sensors on the trucks then that are monitoring things like temperature?<br /> <br />MATT:</p><p class="spiel"> Yup, and so that is the IOT devices. Monsanto actually builds these IOT devices in house and they monitor all this information and those get installed in the trucks. The IOT device is what's actually sending that information up so that we can consuming it. RON</p><p class="speaker">RON:</p><p class="spiel"> Really? Great okay. Good.  MATT</p><p class="speaker">MATT:</p><p class="spiel"> So we’ll just go right into the demo here. So if you look at this, these trucks - these icons right here – are representing trucks that are down in South America in Argentina. These little icons are actually real trucks that are down there with IOT devices sending that up and we’re consuming that on the screen. If you actually look at these - this little red icon here represents facility and so these trucks are actually resting at the facility right now. We can look at the information displayed on the truck and we can see this box is empty so it must've just unloaded. It's not moving. Its temperature is fine - it's at 34°C. It’s right at the Rojas facility. As a facility owner you can filter out and pick what facilities are relevant to you and what information you're looking for. If you're only looking for trucks that are in a particular danger zone - which might be 41 to 60°C - those would be trucks that are overheating. As you can see there are some trucks. If we zoom in - these parts and trucks that are red are in the 48°C and they’re in a danger zone. So these trucks are at risk of actually overheating and spoiling and they are in a danger zone. RON</p><p class="speaker">RON:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel"> Is this in real time here?<br /> <br />MATT:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel"> This is in real time. <br /><br />RON:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel"> That's a truck in Argentina somewhere?<br /> <br />MATT:</p><p class="spiel"> That is a truck in Argentina somewhere.</p><p class="speaker"><br />RON:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel"> It is starting to get too hot?<br /> <br />MATT:</p><p class="spiel"> Yes exactly. RON</p><p class="speaker">RON:</p><p class="spiel"> Very interesting. MATT</p><p class="speaker">MATT:</p><p class="spiel"> A couple of the options that they wanted was a sort of a simple map, but we can look at more like a topographical map. So you can kind of dive in and see real pieces of the map of what we’re looking at here. You can see the city and the roads and the streets and maybe some more information about it.  RON</p><p class="speaker">RON:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel"> That's impressive.<br /> <br />MATT:</p><p class="spiel"> I will switch back to see some of the icons, and we can also see a table view here so you can see a little bit more granular data there. You can export out your data if you wanted that for any reason. You can see the history and where the truck was location-wise. You can also see what the temperature of the truck was for the past week and you can use that to sort of build metrics and determine what routes the trucks are taking and if they are overheating, how many trucks are overheating, and kind of determine information off of that. RON</p><p class="speaker">RON:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel"> Super job there, Matt. Very impressive using leading technology to drive millions of dollars of business value for an important customer. What can be better than that? Good job. What was the Daugherty approach? What made our approach better than what someone else might've done?<br /> <br />ERIC:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel"> Yeah absolutely. I think when you look at that we need to recognize that this was a product we built out of our Development Center. For those who are unaware, anything that we build out of our Development Center is a local delivery model meaning for Monsanto we are a down the street model.<br /> <br />RON:</p><p class="spiel"> A real hybrid approach.</p><p class="speaker"><br />ERIC:</p><p class="spiel"> Exactly.</p><p class="speaker"><br />RON:</p><p class="spiel"> Now, did one of you mentioned that we had a Daugherty University graduate working on this project? MATT</p><p class="speaker">MATT:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel"> Yeah. Brigita was a Daugherty University graduate. This was her first project after Daugherty University and so this was her first dive-in professional work after Daugherty University. She did a great job and we made a fantastic app.<br /> <br />RON:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel"> Excellent. Our Development Center makes that even a little easier to do doesn't it? So we can control the environment, provide the appropriate amount of oversight, and deliver great value proposition to the customer. Great! Thanks for joining me today.<br /> <br />BOTH:</p><p class="spiel"> Thank you for having us. RON</p><p class="speaker">RON:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel"> Really nice job. Very impressive work and quite a nice success story. Alright, thanks everybody. Thanks for listening. I will talk you again soon.</p>
