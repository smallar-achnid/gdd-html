<p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	Hello, everybody. I've taken an unintentional hiatus from these podcast over the last few weeks, but I'm glad to be back, and we'll be doing a podcast every other week for the rest of the year now. In this podcast, we'll be covering highlights from 2018, wrapping up the contests that we've been conducting over the last six podcasts, and sharing with you a video, a very nice video that our marcom organization put together. Don't forget to tune in next time. I'll be sharing with you our vision at Daugherty for 2019. Thanks, everybody.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	(singing).</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	Before get started with our 2018 highlights, let me share with you some important anniversary dates. In St. Louis, Blake Schreiner, Alex Wade, and Lester Bradshaw have all been with us for five years. Congratulations. In Atlanta, Brian Crenshaw and Daniel Ribic have been with the company for five years, and in Dallas, Chris Wong has been with the company for five years. Congratulations, Chris.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	Because of all your good work, we had a great year in 2018. Let's take a look at few of the highlights. As an enterprise, we achieve double-digit revenue growth coming in just shy of 190 million. We achieved a lot of success in each of our business units. Chicago posted its largest year-over-year revenue gain, 25% growth. Dallas finished 2018 with 20% revenue growth. Minneapolis grew revenue over 20% in 2018 while also leading the New York, New Jersey market launch. St. Louis posted nice gains with over 80 million in revenue here in St. Louis. Atlanta increased revenue by 10% in 2018 and is well-positioned to perform extremely well in 2019. The New York, New Jersey business officially launched, and formal plans and investments for 2019 are already under way.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	Now, client-by-client. Let's take a look at some highlights. At Behr and Climate Control Corporation, our team has grown to more than 130 consultants. We've added nearly 50 consultants to the team this year, and we'll be adding in another 30 in just the next two weeks. Our Home Depot client in Atlanta doubled in size in 2018, and now we have a team of 50 consultants at Home Depot. For each of these clients, there's an excellent leadership and an excellent group of consultants. I can't call out everybody's name here, but I appreciate every one of you. Our presence at Cox Communication grew by a third in 2018. We now have a team of 75 at Cox. In Chicago, our leadership at Walgreens has led to significant growth from a team of 40 to a team of 70, and going strong.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	In terms of new clients, in Dallas, we've begun doing project work with Allstate Insurance. In Minneapolis, we added Compeer Financial to our growing list of customers in the Twin Cities. In St. Louis, we've added Climate Corporation, Royal Canin, Contegix, GKN Aerospace in the City of St. Louis.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	We made several investments across the Daugherty enterprise in 2018. Daugherty University was one of those. I really like the Daugherty University program. We supported several Daugherty University classes. We kicked off a Daugherty University class in Minneapolis for the first time, and it was a good one. There was a lot of college recruiting, a lot of teamwork associated with that, and because of the success we've had with Daugherty University, we're in the process of building a year-round Daugherty University program.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	We made significant investments in Daugherty's agile capabilities. We brought Doug Dockery on board as our enterprise agile leader and partnered with ICAgile to develop a suite of agile training courses. We also added a number of agile coaches, scrum masters, and product owners to our team. We also invested heavily in our data and analytics capabilities. We had a data and analytics panel discussion at the Gateway to Innovation event. Very good event with senior leaders from a number of companies that we facilitated. We sponsored a data and analytics executive meetup that included some of the leading data scientists and chief data officers from the region here in St. Louis. I really like the idea of doing that sort of thing everywhere that we do business. We'll be talking about that further.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	We're continuing to increase collaboration across all of our business units, not only in data and analytics, but also in cloud, UI UX, and so on. We dramatically expanded our development center capabilities. We promoted Jim Drewes to an enterprise role as our software engineering leader. We expanded our development center space in St. Louis to add room for more than 100 additional engineers. We began doing development center work in Dallas for the first time and have seen a rising demand for software engineering and development center capabilities just across the entire enterprise everywhere in the country.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	In terms of career management, we added 25 new delivery roles in 2018, significantly increasing the flexibility within Daugherty for career development. Also, a consultant can now be recognized for multiple roles across multiple lines of service. We made a number of investments in the areas of employee engagement, health and wellness, and awards. Over 200 training courses were delivered in the course of 2018. In addition, Daugherty hosted numerous technical meetups, hackathons, happy hours, and coding challenges, which offered our consultants opportunities to mingle and learn new things.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	In 2018, we launched new quarterly health and wellness initiatives geared toward maintaining a healthy diet and staying active. In fact, for the first time ever, Daugherty was recognized with two health and wellness awards. We were recognized as a finalist for the St. Louis Business Journal's Healthiest Employer Award, and we won a Health Achievement Award from the American Heart Association. We were also delighted to have both a 30 Under 30 award winner, Alex Gillette, and a 40 Under 40 winner, Andre Stevens.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	There are hundreds of organizations that our employees support, which is very inspiring. Here are a few highlights from Daugherty community outreach activities from across the enterprise in 2018. In Atlanta, we held our fifth annual Women in Technology Immersion experience. A team of Daugherty consultants led a hands-on STEM workshop with 25 high school girls to teaching them valuable life skills and to serve as mentors for the next generation of women in technology. In Chicago, not only did we continue our support of the United Way of Lake County, our teammates also partnered with the Northern Illinois Food Bank to pack over 15,000 meals for local Chicago kids. The meals were given school-age children in extreme need so they would have food during the weekends when school's not in session.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	In Dallas, Team Daugherty came together to collect clothes for the local Dress for Success organization. Our colleagues collected over 30 bags of professional attire to donate to women in the community to help them find their footing at the start of their professional journey. During our Minneapolis business unit's annual Day of Service, our teammates assisted with-need facility maintenance, cleaning up the playground at FamilyWise, repainting their indoor play area, and tending to the garden.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	In New York, New Jersey, the team collected holiday gifts for the Passaic County Division of Child Protection and Permanency. Daugherty contributed a host of items, including clothing and toys, which will do wonders in helping local families have a Christmas to remember.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	Last fall, the St. Louis team completed a two-week campaign to support the United Way of Greater St. Louis. After kicking off the campaign with the Battle of the Corporate Bands event, our team raised over $60,000, which Jan and I were happy to match. In total, our campaign raised over $130,000, an amount that will touch many lives around the St. Louis area.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	Finally, based on a very collaborative team effort within Daugherty, we brought millions of dollars in revenue and thousands of visitors from across the world to the City of St. Louis for the USA Fencing National Championships. The event was one of the well-attended in the history of US fencing.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	I'd like to personally thank each of you for the positive difference that you've made for our company, our customers, and our communities. I really appreciate it, and I'm proud to be your teammate.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel">	As you know, we've been conducting a contest over the last six podcast, but I haven't really said what the contest is about. Well, for each of our previous six podcasts, there was an article on-screen from one of our business unit cities, so each business unit city, all six were represented, and for anyone who can submit to marcom@daugherty.com a list of those six cities in order, you'll be a winner. You'll be a winner. Marcom will contact you and get from you the size and style of Daugherty T-shirt that you'd like, and we'll get it right out to you. This contest will be open to all Daugherty entrants until 8:</p><p class="spiel">00 a.m. Monday morning, so you'll have a couple days, and the weekend. Hopefully, you'll have time to go back, take a look, and we'll be proud to give you a Daugherty T-shirt. Thanks for playing along.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel">	Thanks again, everyone, for all that you do. As we wrap up this podcast, I'd like to share with you a video that our marcom organization put together that does a nice job of capturing the Daugherty culture. Thanks, everybody.</p>
