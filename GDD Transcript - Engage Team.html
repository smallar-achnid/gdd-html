<p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	The podcast today focuses on a group whose mission is to provide support to you. I think you'll be interested in hearing about all the great things the Engage Team is doing and how you can participate and benefit even more. Also, we'll be covering some important employee anniversary dates and some really interesting and impressive company highlights. 	And now for some important employee anniversary dates. First of all in St. Louis, Matt Henroid and Kim Andreadis have been with the company for 10 years. That's fantastic. Also here in St. Louis, David Raymond, Susan King, Angela Morgan, Diane Pfitzinger, Lynn Torres, Tracy Piedmont, Craig Rich, and Tina Wetterau have each been with Daugherty for five years. Congratulations. And three five-year anniversary dates in Minneapolis. Jessica Dehncke, Lisa Kotaseck, and Joseph Strano, each at five years. That's wonderful. And then in Atlanta, we have Naveen Konreddy who's been with Daugherty for five years. I really appreciate all your great service to Daugherty, all you've done for the organization. Thank you very much. 	I'd like to share some impressive highlights with you from around the Daugherty enterprise. In Dallas, the Daugherty team at Southwest Airlines successfully delivered another huge win. Our team of Chris Wong, Armel Maemble, Joseph [inaudible 00</p><p class="speaker">	I'd like to share some impressive highlights with you from around the Daugherty enterprise. In Dallas, the Daugherty team at Southwest Airlines successfully delivered another huge win. Our team of Chris Wong, Armel Maemble, Joseph [inaudible 00:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel">01:</p><p class="spiel">55] and Shubham Roy partnered with the client to improve pricing options for customers by increasing the number of fare classes from 15 to 26. Southwest projects that this change will increase revenue by 78 million dollars annually. Our team delivered and managed the launch with zero incidents enterprise wide. Congratulations team. Now that's some great business impact. Great job. 	In Minneapolis, Daugherty helped support the Best Buy Foundation in their 25th Annual Best Buy Charity Classic. This yearly event is Best Buy's major fund raiser and a great opportunity for Daugherty to give back while helping grow our partnership. Rob Jacobs, Nicole Manes, Jessica Dehncke, Reuben van Hemert and Nick Reinbold spent the evening mingling with several of our client leaders from Best Buy. They even took in a concert featuring country superstar Sam Hunt, all while raising more than four million dollars to support STEM education for teens in underserved communities. Now that sounds like it was great event and a great time. </p><p class="spiel">	In St. Louis, we've grown to more than 500 consultants in the market, a significant milestone and our development center has surpassed 100 teammates. With all this expansion, we've had to increase our physical footprint and are now wrapping up a major renovation of our office space spanning three floors of the City Place building. We've added 25,000 square feet of additional office and meeting space to accommodate new business demands and we've even hung our name on the side of the building. I like that a lot. All this speaks to the great work that's being done in the field and the support from our leaders around the company. Thank you for all you do.</p><p class="spiel">	In Chicago, Daugherty's helping Walgreen's CIO Steve Turner and the IT finance team increase the transparency of how revenue's captured and calculated as it moves from the retail store systems to quarterly financial reports. Daugherty teammates Tom Williams and Walid Mouneimne will be helping to work across multiple departments and fill in knowledge gaps by documenting accounting processes from end to end, helping Walgreens leadership understand the different types of revenue that flow their systems. This will allow Walgreens to know who to involve from both the business and the IT side of their organization when making system changes that will improve accuracy of their financial reports. That sounds very, very strategic. Nice job team. </p><p class="spiel">	Our Daugherty agile coaches in New York, New Jersey alongside agile coaches across the enterprise have collaborated to develop an immersive training experience to be rolled out as an offering to client employees at Express Scripts. Currently, coaches in Franklin Lakes, St. Louis, and Minneapolis are facilitating one to three day events to teach story mapping and persona development. Wow, immediately applying it to new product opportunities at Express Scripts. The feedback so far has been very positive, and the Daugherty coaching team will continue to work with their teams to help ensure the new skills take root as normal, repeatable techniques to help enable the flow of work. Excellent.</p><p class="spiel">	I'd like you to meet the Engage Team today. The Engage Team covers a lot of ground. They're doing a lot of things that I think you'll enjoy hearing about, hearing how you might be able to participate, and especially benefit from all the things that are going on at engage. So let's start with some introductions if you don't mind in that.Annette</p><p class="speaker">Annette:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel">	Yeah, absolutely. Hello everyone, and thanks Ron for having us on here. Our main purpose for today is just so you guys get to know us better and utilize us better. Like Ron said, we're an enterprise team, so we're here for everyone. All branches, all cities, everything. So I'm gonna off by just introducing my team to you. Maribeth is the only one that could join us so we'll go ahead and introduce everybody on the team. We'll start out with [inaudible 00:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel">07:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel">01]. She's in charge of Engage, and you'll probably have seen a lot of her e-mails communicating all of our events and classes on Engage. We have Amber Pogue who also helps with Engage and rewards. But she's also in charge of Empower, which is our performance management system. We have Liz [inaudible 00:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel">07:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel">21], who is our Connect Daugherty share point lead. We have Jake Petri who works on [inaudible 00:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel">07:</p><p class="spiel">30] which is our recruiting tool. And then lastly but not least, is my friend here Maribeth Bendick, but I'll let her explain what she does.</p><p class="speaker">Maribeth:</p><p class="spiel">	Thanks Annette. Hi everyone, I'm Maribeth Bendick as Annette mentioned. And I am currently the internship program coordinator, which I've had a great pleasure of working with five wonderful individuals. They are by far exceeding my expectations. Doing a great job this summer. And something I also do is I'm the Enterprise Awards and Recognition Committee lead. And I do a portion of new hire orientation where I walk new hires through the new hire checklist. I'm involved in some of Daugherty's Community Outreach Efforts. And lastly, but not least, I am the Enterprise Health and Wellness lead. </p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	Alright, that's a lot of good stuff.</p><p class="speaker">Maribeth:</p><p class="spiel">	Yeah, a lot of fun stuff.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	Yeah, great. Interns, training, recognition, onboarding, orientation. That's great.</p><p class="speaker">Maribeth:</p><p class="spiel">	Yeah, a lot of fun stuff.	So I'd like to take an opportunity and basically walk through our Health and Wellness program. A year in review. We started this year off in quarter one by focusing on a campaign called Know Your Numbers, where we encouraged all employees do go the doctor and get their annual physical. Quarter two is what we're currently in and we're focusing on fitness and encouraging people focus to get moving. We did this by facilitating two different step challenges. Our first step challenge was in May, and it was an individual challenge where anyone across the company, they could participate. And basically, anyone that achieved their 56,000 steps per week goal were entered into a raffle. And we are currently in their group step challenge, which is battle of the branches. And with the final days just wrapping up, the winners undetermined, but we should have a winner by the time this airs.Ron Daugherty</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	That's great. So we have local Health and Wellness representatives in each of our business units.</p><p class="speaker">Maribeth:</p><p class="spiel">	That's right.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	And you the Engage Team works with the local representatives and so if I'm in Atlanta or in New York, New Jersey, any of the offices and I'd like to participate, sign up, I can talk to my local rep. And if I'm sure who that is, maybe I could call you, and you'll help me with that.</p><p class="speaker">Maribeth:</p><p class="spiel">	Absolutely. Any time. Happy to assist. </p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	A lot of things going on in Q2, what about Q3?</p><p class="speaker">Maribeth:</p><p class="spiel">	Great, I'm glad you asked. So Q3, we will be focusing on creating healthy goals. In fact, I would like to invite everyone to our kickoff meeting on July 19th. It is open to all Daugherty employees who are interested in health. We will be focusing on ways to improve and create healthy goals.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	So how do we sign up for that? How do we produce that?</p><p class="speaker">Maribeth:</p><p class="spiel">	You can actually go into Engage and go in the calendar to enroll. If you're not quite sure on how to do that, contact me and I'd be happy to walk you through it.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	Okay. Wonderful. And you know in the spirit of making this support, this great support available from Engage, just more accessible to everyone, what are the things we should be looking for in terms of events coming up or opportunities? Just what are the things I should be doing to make sure I don't miss something really good from the Engage Team?</p><p class="speaker">Maribeth:</p><p class="spiel">	Sure. We will be sending out an event announcement and reminders via e-mail. We also have a Slack channel for Health and Wellness, and you can contact me directly to get on our Health and Wellness distribution list. And that's it.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	The Engage calendar, is that something everyone should be looking at?</p><p class="speaker">Maribeth:</p><p class="spiel">	The Engage calendar, you can check out from us.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	So that's pretty important isn't it? And how do you access the Engage calendar?</p><p class="speaker">Annette:</p><p class="spiel">	You can get into Engage via www.engagedaugherty.com or when you see something in your e-mail that you're interested. A class, an event, anything. You can click on it and it will take you right to this URL.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	Okay, great.</p><p class="speaker">Annette:</p><p class="spiel">	So once you're there, you're just gonna click on this calendar icon right over here to the left. And you will see, as we are almost in July right now, you can go ahead and click on that event. Once you click on it, you can click the enroll button. And once you enroll in the event, you will get a calendar invite on your Outlook calendar reminding you of the event and the time.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	That's great. Very convenient.</p><p class="speaker">Annette:</p><p class="spiel">	Okay. Since we're in Engage, another great thing that we have is on our What's Happening wall, we have our Boost Recognition program. Maribeth, do you want to kind of explain what that is? And I can show everyone.</p><p class="speaker">Maribeth:</p><p class="spiel">	Absolutely, sure. Our Boost Recognition program is our internal recognition system, where employees are able to boost one another and team managers are recognized when their teammates have been boosted.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	That sounds like a great idea.</p><p class="speaker">Annette:</p><p class="spiel">	Yeah. So let's boost Ron and Jan. As an example.	Your first boost, Ron. I'm sure not your first, but at least from us. So we'll go ahead and boost Ron. So whenever you're boosting anyone, you always put the &quot;at symbol&quot; first, and then their name will start to be recognized. So as you can see, I put the &quot;at symbol.&quot;Ron Daugherty</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	And this is from Engage? </p><p class="speaker">Annette:</p><p class="spiel">	This is in Engage.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	Inside Engage you can boost?</p><p class="speaker">Annette:</p><p class="spiel">	Absolutely.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	That's good. And you know, one of the things that's so important to us is how we support and collaborate with each other. And just something that I've noticed is that all of us see very positive things that our teammates are doing all the time. And why is that? Because we have great teammates who are doing great things. So we see it, and any opportunity to give positive reinforcement is worth taking advantage of for all of us.</p><p class="speaker">Annette:</p><p class="spiel">	Right. And it really unites us as team Daugherty when you're recognizing each other. Your peers, your managers, anyone. Because it re-emphasizes how important our unity as team Daugherty is. And this is a great tool where people get recognized, we get to show managers all the great things that are going on at Daugherty.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	That's great. And you know, just one really important thing that has been on my mind for at least 30 years as the company grows, and I think everyone knows I'm committed to the continued growth of the company. As we get bigger, I want us to get better. And so what usually happens when a company gets bigger? Often companies get less well connected, they collaborate less, they end up in silos, they don't have the power of the entire enterprise. They have just pieces of it any one point in time. And it's easy to drift in that direction so anything that we can do to bring us together as an enterprise team, to collaborate with each other, to recognize each other, and to be better connected with each other. Such an important thing and this is one of the ways we can do it. To engage through some of the things we're talking about today.</p><p class="speaker">Annette:</p><p class="spiel">	So there you go everybody. Straight from Ron Daugherty. Boost your peers. He's been thinking about it for 30 years, everybody's got to do it.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	From the horse's mouth.</p><p class="speaker">Annette:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel">	Yeah. So here we have Ron and Jan's boost for understanding the importance of our Health and Wellness program here. So it's awesome to work for a company that invests so much time and energy into strengthening this type of program which encourages employees to get healthy. So the only last thing you have to do when you're boosting someone is you always want to put the name [inaudible 00:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel">14:</p><p class="spiel">59] because that's going to make sure that it goes to our Boost Recognition Coordinator so that Jan and Ron can get their deserved points for Engage.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	That's great, well I really appreciate that. I'm looking forward to getting those points. And well tell me. Now that I'm the recipient of some points, what happens? What can I do with those points?</p><p class="speaker">Annette:</p><p class="spiel">	Okay. So now that Ron's gonna get all kinds of points, any recognition can be between 20 points and 250. I'm sure you're going to get the max of 250 for this one Ron, but don't quote me on that because I'm not the admin. But once Ron, or anybody that's been boosted, gets the points, they can go to their &quot;My Rewards&quot; down here. And basically, the My Rewards program takes all of the points that you've earned and allows you to be able to take your points and redeem them. So there's two ways to redeem, Ron. The first way is to donate. So each one of our charities that we have in each branch has a donation. So I can donate 250 points or $25 towards any charity. Just so-</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	Okay. There's some arithmetic I want to follow. So 250 points is $25?</p><p class="speaker">Annette:</p><p class="spiel">	You got it.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	Okay, alright. Good.</p><p class="speaker">Annette:</p><p class="spiel">	And just so everybody knows. As far as charity, we've donated since Engage started $4,450 towards all the different charities here.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	That's wonderful and that's through our employees receiving boost points and then donating those boost points to a worthy cause.</p><p class="speaker">Annette:</p><p class="spiel">	You got it Ron, yep.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	That's wonderful. What a generous group of teammates we have. Beautiful.</p><p class="speaker">Annette:</p><p class="spiel">	It is, yep. And the other way you can redeem your points if you didn't want to donate to a charity would be towards Swag.</p><p class="speaker">Maribeth:</p><p class="spiel">	Your Swag is not here, Ron.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	So that's why I'm wearing this impressive jacket, okay.</p><p class="speaker">Annette:</p><p class="spiel">	So again, just to recap on our recognition and points and rewards. So there's two ways you can get points on Engage. One, you can get boosted or recognized like we just showed you with Ron and Jan. And the second way is to attend training or events. And that's the part I'm gonna kinda go into a little bit further 'cause I want you guys to understand how great our training program is here. And again, that's another way you can earn points.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	Wonderful, so training's so important to us. And anything we can do to make it more accessible, to recognize those who are taking advantage of it. That's great stuff.</p><p class="speaker">Annette:</p><p class="spiel">	Yes, absolutely. So just so you guys know, there is 685 classes that have gone on Engage since it went live in August of 2016. So almost two years this August, there's been 685 classes. And the most impressive stat is 68 percent of Daugherty employees have at least taken one class this year. Whether it be a lunch and learn, a social event, or anything, 68 percent of Daugherty people have done something to sign up in Engage and participate somehow.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	That's excellent. You know something that I believe is that smart people like to learn.</p><p class="speaker">Annette:</p><p class="spiel">	Yes, always learning.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	And this is some evidence of it. We have our smart people and they like to learn and get even smarter. Okay, that's great.</p><p class="speaker">Annette:</p><p class="spiel">	Yes, and Maribeth and I do onboarding. And one of the number one things when we ask, &quot;Why Daugherty? Why'd you come here?&quot; They always say, &quot;'Cause you guys have such a great training program.&quot; So not only does that benefit current employees, but new employees are attracted to that. So as you're talking to your friends and different people about coming to Daugherty, use training as a great example of why Daugherty is different than anywhere else. Because we have such a great training program.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	That aligns with our business model in so many ways. And at the heart of our business model is we want to hire talented people and invest in those talented people and put them in situations where they can continue to grow and develop with the company, so we can have long term business relationships that are good for all of us. Good for all of us. And this is one of the ways that we make that happen. Great stuff.</p><p class="speaker">Annette:</p><p class="spiel">	Yeah, absolutely. And I'm just gonna emphasize on the growth. So as we grow, and the bigger that we get, obviously we want to keep a line in our training. We don't want people to develop other training that's already been done. So we've developed an Enterprise Training Committee. From each branch, they have a representative and I'm sure we'll show their names on their screen here. And this committee meets and talks about what training needs are important in their city. Has somebody already done it before? How can we work together as a Daugherty team with our training model? 	So lastly, before we end here, I just want to take the opportunity to tell everybody out there that one of the great parts about training is here at Daugherty, we empower people to create training and we encourage people to bring their ideas of maybe things that they've noticed. Gaps or things that they could improve on personally and they do some research and want to bring it to other teammates to help them. We encourage internal training here. So, please contact me about any opportunities or any training that you'd be interested in doing. And thanks Ron, for having such an open atmosphere for people to bring all of their gifts and their talents to be able to train others on it.Ron Daugherty</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel">	Well you're very welcome and thanks to you for all the help and support. And great job on the podcast today. Thanks for joining me.</p><p class="speaker">Annette:</p><p class="spiel">	Thank you, yeah. Thanks for having us.</p><p class="speaker">Maribeth:</p><p class="spiel">	Thanks for having us.</p><p class="speaker">Ron Daugherty:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel">	And so what a wonderful support mechanism we have here with Engage. So hopefully now, everyone can see ways to benefit from it to participate with Engage even more. And I really enjoyed the podcast today, this was great. And thanks to all of you for listening. We'll talk to you soon.</p>
