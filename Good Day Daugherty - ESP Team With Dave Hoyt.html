<p class="speaker">RON:</p><p class="spiel"> We have a very special guest with us today, Dave Hoyt. Many of you know Dave and you know that Dave runs a very strategic component of our business associated with thought leadership, as well as enterprise delivery excellence. So, I'm pleased to share with you an update today on some things that are going on, some progress that's been made, and how you can map into those capabilities to help you personally and your client. In addition, we have some very interesting company highlights and success stories. All this and more on today's episode of Good Day Daugherty. </p><p class="spiel"> RON</p><p class="speaker">RON:</p><p class="spiel"> Here are some highlights from around the Daugherty enterprise. Let's start with Atlanta. At Cox Communications, a major milestone was achieved in late January with the inaugural launch of Cox’s new residential voice service in their Middle Georgia market.  Cox has been working to replace existing legacy telephone networks with new IP-based voice services. So, the launch of this first market has been years in the making with support from a great Daugherty team, and we first engaged back in May 2014. So, based on excellent client delivery that Daugherty provided, our teams continue to grow and going forward Daugherty will continue to support the program, working with the Cox team to launch all of the remaining 23 sites, and migrate and install a base of 2.3 million residential customers to the new IP platform. Very good - congratulations there in Atlanta. An interesting update from Dallas is that Daugherty is now among a small group of firms under consideration to lead Southwest Airlines through an enterprise-wide Agile transformation. I love Agile transformations. The RFP process has whittled down a large number of firms and Daugherty is one of the few remaining.  This would be a huge win for the team in Dallas, as well as our entire company, and it would position us to advise and execute how Southwest should be working to deliver software across their entire organization. The team is “all hands on deck” and pulling in help and support from across the enterprise. We appreciate everyone's help with this. Very strategic, very exciting, and we’re making great progress. In Chicago I'd like to congratulate Janet Copella. She's been with Daugherty for 25 years and celebrated her 25th anniversary with us on February 1<sup>st.</sup>  Congratulations Janet! Also, the Chicago Daugherty organization supported the American lung Association in the Fight for air Climb at the Oak Brook Tower building on February 10<sup>th.</sup> That's a very tall building and it happens to be the one that our Daugherty offices are located in there in Chicago. Let's take a look at our team of climbers. Great job everybody! Thanks for supporting such a great cause. In Minneapolis the team within Daugherty's Best Buy Large Product Fulfillment Group, which is the appliances organization, has entered into its second year. The team has grown and will continue to grow because we've brought a unique combination of process improvement techniques, the ability to mine data for business insights, and an ability to work collaboratively across multiple functional groups to drive change at Best Buy. The results of our work can be seen in cost savings for Best Buy and improvement in customer NPS - Net Promoter Score. Okay. Congrats to Jessica Dehncke and Emily Dressen and their teams for continued growth and exceptional client delivery. Good job. In New York/New Jersey, our team achieved an interesting milestone. We had our first in-person training class there; we had been using WebEx for the most part up until now. This is another indication of where are headed in that great New York New Jersey area. We are supporting more, and building on the success of, our great teammates there. Wes Strait led and engaged the team through RPM inception and elaboration, and the team put what they learned directly into action with some entertaining and creative hands-on exercises to scope out an ERP deployment for Dean's Bait and Tackle - I believe Dean is one of our great teammates there in New York/New Jersey - and a new call center package for WesCo. I'm guessing that was named after Wes Strait. As the team closed out the night, several opportunities were identified to put RPM to use in both new and existing areas within our Express Scripts team in Franklin Lakes. Here's a picture of the class. Over the last nine months in St. Louis, several of our Daugherty team members at Anheuser-Busch have helped transform the way brewery workers access data in the packaging process throughout AB's 18 breweries in the US and Canada. Brewery…try saying that five times fast! Through a collection of dashboards called mission control, AB employees can now see information about packaging lines at a glance and in real time. Very important. Let's take a look at one of the Mission Control dashboards that the team developed. Great stuff and this project will continue to move forward with the second generation of displays and dashboards. Many thanks to Greg Fey and Eric Maurer for the great work that they've done on this initiative. Good job. </p><p class="spiel"> RON</p><p class="speaker">RON:</p><p class="spiel"> We have a special guest with us today, Dave Hoyt. Dave runs a very strategic part of the organization that's focused on our high-end thought leadership, as well as enterprise-wide delivery excellence. So, many of you know Dave, but if you don't mind just give us an update on what's going on in your part of the company. DAVE</p><p class="speaker">DAVE:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel"> Sure. I think I've met most of the people that will be seeing this, but I’ve been with Daugherty about 19 years now, and as part of that I have played many roles with the organization. I started out in roles really focused on delivery. I ran the St. Louis business unit for about five years, and now I really have enterprise-level responsibilities for a number of our teams. Really kind of four key areas:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel"> I’m responsible for our enterprise strategy and planning team, as well as our enterprise COE's, delivery quality across the organization, and our capability development and capability training.<br /> <br />RON:</p><p class="spiel"> Yeah great overview Dave. I am anxious to dive into each of those areas. They’re each very interesting, but before we do, share with us the best way to work with you and your organization. DAVE</p><p class="speaker">DAVE:</p><p class="spiel"> Sure. So, across the enterprise teams we’re really very focused on supporting the client teams. The client teams are the ultimate consumer of everything we do and it's very important that, ultimately, the client teams own the results and own the relationships. So, think of us as really playing a supporting role there, and that supporting role can be across multiple dimensions. That might be bringing additional thought leadership to the client, it might be business development support for a very strategic opportunity, it might be an opportunity to do a very senior-level strategy or management consulting engagement.</p><p class="speaker"><br />RON:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel"> It really all comes to life when it is mapped into or integrated with the client plan.<br /> <br />DAVE:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel"> That's right.<br /> <br />RON:</p><p class="spiel"> Yeah. You know if we have a plan for the client…we have a plan and we have objectives, then our organization can provide support to those. It's one of the ways we differentiate. It is one of the ways that we get to higher levels in the client organization, so when we talk to more senior managers and executives in the client organization they’re less interested in talking about their immediate needs and more interested in hearing about industry-leading practices, what other organizations are doing that are successful organizations who are tackling some of the same issues that they have.</p><p class="speaker"><br />DAVE:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel"> It really has been a great strategy for us, and a good example would be General Mills. Within two meetings with the CFO we were signing a $1.4 million SOW. So, it can sometimes be a very fast path to gaining credibility very rapidly.<br /> <br />RON:</p><p class="spiel"> Yeah, I remember that one. That's a great example. Dave, any other thoughts on how to best interface with you and your team? DAVE</p><p class="speaker">DAVE:</p><p class="spiel"> I think if there's a request for support, please provide those to myself and we’ll talk a little bit more about Ken Mersmann's role and Naveen Pinjani’s role - they both play key leadership roles for us as part of the enterprise team.</p><p class="speaker"><br />RON:</p><p class="spiel"> Okay so let's get into a little more detail around the who and the what is available to us. DAVE</p><p class="speaker">DAVE:</p><p class="spiel"> Absolutely. So, let's start with enterprise strategy and planning team. There’s really two sides to the work that we do there. One is what I would consider CIO-level IT management consulting work and this might be helping clients with their overarching IT strategy, application portfolio rationalization…it might be related to strategic sourcing analysis. Some good examples there right now are the work that Nathan Orwig is doing in Atlanta for Paradies shops to really help them look at their entire application portfolio and make recommendations in terms of a full ERP implementation that they're now kicking off. </p><p class="speaker"><br />RON:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel"> That's great. So, if you're in an airport and you go into a big gift shop there, it's probably a Paradies shop.<br /> <br />DAVE:</p><p class="spiel"> Exactly. Ken Mersmann and Kevin Corr have been helping quite a bit leading a strategic sourcing engagement with Cox communications, where we’re looking at about $185 million of their third-party spend and helping them determine the best way to engage their partners and spend that money. We’re helping them select the right engagement models and helping them look for better ways to engage their partners. RON</p><p class="speaker">RON:</p><p class="spiel"> Yeah, I know the entire Cox team has been doing a great job and this has been one of our big differentiators to show that we have even more to offer than good, smart people and project and program management…all really important, but we have even more than that in terms of thought leadership and thereby it makes a lot of sense for senior client executives to have a relationship with us. DAVE</p><p class="speaker">DAVE:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel"> That's right. It's one of the best tools we have to position as a trusted advisor at those most senior levels by bringing value.<br /> <br />RON:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel"> Wonderful.<br /> <br />DAVE:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel"> So that’s one aspect of what we do with the ES&amp;P team and the other aspect is what I would consider more business advisory work. It’s focused on solving big business problems that those clients have. Good examples there would be helping Frito-Lay design and come up their new go to market strategy, work that we have helped Anheuser-Busch do around optimizing their production line up time and reducing downtime of those production lines, and then also the work that we have done in the past with like Coca-Cola to help them redo their entire customer segmentation framework.<br /> <br />RON:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel"> Really good higher-level industry focused advisory services.<br /> <br />DAVE:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel"> That's right. In all those examples we’re usually working with either the CEO, the president of the company, or one of their direct reports.<br /> <br />RON:</p><p class="spiel"> Okay and we can bring that kind of thought leadership to most any industry. Some might be a bit deeper than others, but we have something to say about healthcare, financial services, consumer package goods, retail, transportation, hospitality and so on. DAVE</p><p class="speaker">DAVE:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel"> Absolutely and the many times we talk about the fact that we see Daugherty as really, fundamentally, a business problem solving machine.<br /> <br />RON:</p><p class="spiel"> I like that.  DAVE</p><p class="speaker">DAVE:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel"> The other aspects of the team I’ll mention will be the enterprise COEs as well. So, we have three enterprise COEs:</p><p class="spiel"> Data and Analytics, Customer Engagement and Digital Marketing, and Agile transformation. So, on the data and analytics front, the work that Naveen Pinjani has been doing is very representative. He's been working with Express Scripts to help them redesign their data and analytics strategy; working at the highest levels within the organization and with Cox Communications helping them look at how to take their data services group to be more service oriented and aligned to a new organizational model. RON</p><p class="speaker">RON:</p><p class="spiel"> Data and analytics…do you think that's going to go anywhere Dave? Do you think it’s going to amount to anything out there in the business world? DAVE</p><p class="speaker">DAVE:</p><p class="spiel"> I think so. You know it's hard to envision any client out there that wouldn't be interested in hearing more about the strategy work we've done in that data and analytics phase. The Express Scripts example is a great example that most clients would be interested in seeing.<br /> </p><p class="speaker">RON:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel"> Dave that just reminds me how impressive all of your team members are and the groups that you manage. Naveen’s just done a tremendous job for us around the country. We talked about the Paradies shops earlier and I want to make sure we do a shout out to Nathan Orwig…he has really been such a great leader for us there. Good job Nathan. So, Nathan, Naveen, and then we have some other folks that, as we talk about the other areas of focus, let's mention them as well.<br /> <br />DAVE:</p><p class="spiel"> Absolutely. So, in the whole customer engagement and digital marketing space we have JR Slubowski who has really done a great job helping us in a number of client situations. He's actually helped us invent a new term with the Customer Journey Atlas. I believe one of your previous podcasts focused on that whole story as it related to Walgreens. RON</p><p class="speaker">RON:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel"> Yeah, JR really has some good ideas and creative thought leadership. One of the comments he made was in terms of digitally connecting with millennials…that there's a feeling sometimes that the millennials are aliens from the planet digital and he is just connected into that world alien or not. He has a good sure footed approach to it.<br /> <br />DAVE:</p><p class="spiel"> That's right and really one of the big areas we’re focusing on is what we’re increasingly speaking to in terms of the Omni experience. So, while certain individuals are very focused on digital, it doesn't mean they don't still want that interpersonal interaction. RON</p><p class="speaker">RON:</p><p class="spiel"> By the way that was a compliment to all you millennials. Nothing other than that. But yeah that's a great point. Still human interaction plays a role in the integration of the digital and the personal is very powerful isn’t it? DAVE</p><p class="speaker">DAVE:</p><p class="spiel"> It’s critical. The last thing I'll mention is Agile transformation. That's one of the areas we’ve been spending a lot of time and are continuing to build out that that COE. In the interim Terry Mork has been providing a lot of leadership for us, leading that community of practice. We've been doing a lot of great work to help organizations with their Agile transformation. Terry is personally helping lead the Express Scripts engagement, working with Lukas Mayer of Minneapolis and is also helping us with a lot of business development opportunities including Southwest Airlines and McDonald's restaurants.  RON</p><p class="speaker">RON:</p><p class="spiel"> That's great. You were in Atlanta yesterday, weren’t you? DAVE</p><p class="speaker">DAVE:</p><p class="spiel"> That's right. We haven't had a chance to talk yet, but yesterday we had a collaborative session that we facilitated between Monsanto here in St. Louis and Cargill in Minneapolis, and Terry brought some really nice thought leadership to that around the Agile interaction with PMO, Agile transformation and Agile journey. He did a nice job.  RON</p><p class="speaker">RON:</p><p class="spiel"> Great. </p><p class="speaker">DAVE:</p><p class="spiel"> So, the last couple areas I’ll mention quickly would be delivery quality and delivery excellence. That's an area of responsibility Dave LeBlanc has been helping me lead the charge there and Dave's going to be transitioning back into more of a client facing role with the St. Louis branch, but we've been able to build out a very exciting framework and we’re in the middle right now of pilot rollouts of that approach at Monsanto and Charter. By the end of Q1 we’ll be looking to begin a broader enterprise rollout of that framework which includes our internal facing tools as well as a net promoter score survey mechanism with our clients. All to focus on making sure we’re doing the right work in the right way with our clients.</p><p class="speaker"><br />RON:</p><p class="spiel"> That's so important isn’t it? As we grow as a company and add more and more great teammates and new clients, we have to institutionalize and operationalize some things that are just an inherent part of our culture. None of those is more important than delivery excellence. So, just putting something in place that provides tools, a consistent approach, a way for us to do the things that we’re all committed to just through the core values of the organization and doing good work for our customers. Adding more structure to that is one of the ways we will be able to scale while maintaining our culture and commitment to what matters most. DAVE</p><p class="speaker">DAVE:</p><p class="spiel"> Absolutely. It has to be the cornerstone of what we’re building on and so this new program will certainly help with that.</p><p class="speaker"><br />RON:</p><p class="spiel"> That's great and I know Dave’s done a good job and played a big role there. DAVE</p><p class="speaker">DAVE:</p><p class="spiel"> He really has. The last area that I’ll mention quickly will be capability development. One of the things we’re doing right now is a light to moderate refresh of our capability framework as a company, and we’re going to be rolling out a refreshed version of capability training to all our office locations. We’re hopeful that that'll begin in Q2. I think everyone will see a lot of value in the refreshed materials as well as understanding the new capability framework we’re rolling out.</p><p class="speaker"><br />RON:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel"> Daugherty capabilities…that's pretty important isn’t it for us to understand those? So, if we consistently try to understand what our client is working to accomplish and we understand the Daugherty capabilities available to us to help the client achieve those things, then we can really be professional consultants. Without both of those pieces you're just smart people kind of helping out reactively. Adding that to the mix - a little more awareness, a little more attention to where we really are going and what are the Daugherty capabilities. As we grow and we add more and more and more capabilities, it's a little bit more of a challenge to know what those are and how they apply. So, refreshing and continuing to invest in making the support and the training…I know Dave you've led a number of Daugherty capability training classes. Are we going to continue to do that?<br /> <br />DAVE:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel"> Yes, I’ll be personally involved in leading some of those. We’re also going to begin to do a train the trainer type approach and we’re also going to be using some additional video tools that will allow people to pull that information on demand. We hope that between all of those different vehicles there’ll be a good solution for people around capability training.<br /> <br />RON:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel"> That's great. We've covered some great ground here, Dave, and just help us understand a little bit more how all these things that we've talked about can map into our business model to help us differentiate.<br /> <br />DAVE:</p><p class="spiel"> Sure. I think this is right at the heart of one of our biggest differentiators as a company and the key is our ability to deliver great business value to our clients. It allows us to combine the great on the ground visibility that our client teams and the good work that they’re already doing, with the highest level thought leadership that our clients are almost all interested in looking for in a way that we can really tailor solutions that are unique to that client situation. That is unique in the industry. There's a lot of companies out there that can bring thought leadership but it tends to be very generic and there's a lot of companies that have that great on the ground visibility of what really matters and what will make a difference, but there's very few organizations - and I think words we’re the best – with the ability to combine those two in a way that really brings impactful pragmatic recommendations to our clients. RON</p><p class="speaker">RON:</p><p class="spiel"> What a great point and I just see that consistently every time I'm out there. That combination of world-class thought leadership, strong understanding of the customer's business, relationships, and even the client’s culture, and how they get things done. The combination of those two is just unbeatable. You know one of the things that's happened is that Dave and his team are out there talking to senior executives and have built quite a brand and quite a lot of recognition for the thought leadership that they're able to bring, and it opens so many doors when we can have a conversation with the CIO or even a CEO of a major organization about things that we’re seeing that the best and most successful companies are doing, the processes, tools, methods that are useful, and have that combined with our understanding of what matters for that customer. So, a great approach in general and great execution, Dave, by you and your team. I know there are times now when we are working with a customer and they ask for you or Ken or Nathan or JR or one of your folks by name because we've done such a good job of establishing the thought leadership we are able to bring.</p><p class="speaker"><br />DAVE:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel"> Absolutely. Thank you, Ron.<br /> <br />RON:</p><p class="spiel"> Yeah, well great job, Dave. That's an important part of our business that we've been covering here…a very strategic component of how we go to market, how we differentiate, how we bring value to our customers, and how we support all of our teammates. So, appreciate you taking the time to cover that. DAVE</p><p class="speaker">DAVE:</p><p class="spiel"> Thank you. RON</p><p class="speaker">RON:</p><p class="spiel"><p class="spiel"> Alright great. Very good. Thanks everybody, we’ll talk to you soon.</p>
